Normally , if you got down to the docks with a beach totem and fished until you passed out , you ’ d get about 4 seaweed . However , we can do much better . If you got consistent bubble luck , we could multiply that 4 seaweed times 4 to get 16 . Wild bait reduces bite time by 5/8 , which we ’ ll just call 1/2 . This doubles our to total to get 32 .

Lots of people post this , and I made a theory awhile back and it holds some water , so I post it every time for discussion ! So before he left for the war , I suspect he was the go-to jack of all trades . He can fix the plumbing for Gus or shore up the side of Lewis ’ house for the winter . After a while , they got Demetrius , who definitely was in the same boat , but entranced by his work . Well , lets say a tree fell down and they needed it to be cleared , maybe he got Dem to build him some explosives to make it a pretty quick and dirty job . It was effective , so he got some more and just stored them for later purposes . Then [ war were declared . ] He set off to defend his family , town , and country . While he was away , a little city slicker wandered into town with the deed to the old Farm that sat abandoned above Marnie ’ s place . Kent probably knew the old dude who lived there , but paid him no mind unless there was work . That city slicker , who turns out to be the grandchild of the old farmer , started turning things around rapidly . Not only that , this new farmer was making friends with everyone , helping out around town with the little things , and having a keen eye on some of the younger folk in town to settle down with . This got Kent thinking , he really doesn ’ t need to be the go-to guy anymore , the new farmer is there . He can focus on his wife and kids and be a proper husband and father . So as he is acclimating to everything he finds his little trove of bombs he had made for improvement purposes . He just feels ‘ eh , the farmer can use them now…hear that kid is going into the mines ! ’ and sends them over to you .

If you have 8 hearts with all single candidates , all of them will try to flirt with you . This indicates that everyone is bi-sexual , which would be weird to have so many bi-sexuals in a single community , do n't you think ? Also , I 'm pretty sure Leah 's heart event will change depending on the gender that the player created , being female if you are female and male if you are male , making her not really bi-sexual , but player sexual again . In the end , I believe strongly that it was mostly a decision to make the game easier to program to just make all single candidates romanceable regardless of gender . To me , making everyone player sexual dampens the depth of the romance . That being said , stardew really is n't a dating sim as much as it is an artistic form of escapism to being a farmer with a sense of exploration and strengthening your local community .

1705,26,"I 've written about this before , reposting it here : -- - I think this is one of those cases where there 's an acceptable break from reality . It 's not realistic that you can date any of the marriage candidates regardless of the gender , but the game would n't be as appealing to a lot of people if it limited player choice like that . It 's very common that games allowing romances will limit themselves to 1 ( maybe 2 if you 're lucky ) gay option for each gender , which is realistic given the size of the cast and the frequency of gay people in real life , but it means that straight players get to choose who they want to date , while gay players do n't ( and oftentimes that character is bi anyway , so straight players can still choose the opposite sex 's gay option , while gay players only get the one option ) . In real life , there are certainly fewer gay people than straight people , but since there are so many people , the gay dating scene is n't , `` here 's the gay option , take it or leave it . '' In a cast the size of Stardew Valley , realism would dictate that there 's a high chance none of the marriage candidates would be gay . Because of the common game design choice to limit gay players to the designated gay option , if I know a game has romance options going in and allows players to choose their gender , I 've taken to looking up how the game handles same sex relationships , and if it 's just `` here 's your token gay option , take it or leave it , '' I usually end up playing as a female character just so I can still participate in that part of the game . By making all the characters effectively bi , gay male players get to make the same choices as straight female players , and straight male players get the same choices as gay female players , so both gay and straight players alike can enjoy the romance aspects of the game . For gay players , the way Stardew Valley handles the sexuality of the marriage candidates is a nice escape from the reality of real life dating : on top of the chance that the other person just is n't interested in you that straight people also have to deal with , there 's the added challenge that , because of the ratio of gay people to straight people , it is likely that most people you find attractive will turn out to be straight . If you 're straight , and you 've been attracted to a person you later learned was gay , the equivalent experience for a gay person is probably around at least 20 times more probable .",9.0,2020-07-31 10:44:31,241.0,0.014,0.844,0.142,0.9966

Also anything that yields multiple qtys of fruit/vegetable like peppers is def more worth your time . Fortunately my friend and I got our hands on some ancient seeds and increased them exponentially with the seed maker and LOTS of patience . Ancient fruit grows all seasons except for winter c : so then we use the greenhouse . We now have a surplus of ~1500 seeds ready to go every year and the rest we turn into wine .

My main point about the bias is that even though both are pretty rude at the beginning , people were always willing to push through it with Shane more than they were with Clint , even when they had n't been spoiled on their characters . I played the game when it first came out and it was the same way , even before Shane was a romantic possibility ( and before most of his cutscenes were put in ) . But , as you 've noted really ... Shane still turns out to be way more likable at high hearts than Clint ever was , even if he still complains ( with a LOT of merit behind it ) . I personally find it way more rewarding to get through to him than with Clint , even when he was n't a candidate . I was more willing to believe that Clint was a sad and lonely man that just lacked courage to change his life for the better , and had it manifest in unproductive ways .

Krobus also knows , but he understands the wizard and in return , the wizard protects Krobus from the dwarf . Krobus and the dwarf don ’ t like each other after the Elemental War , so naturally they take opposite sides when it comes to the wizard .
