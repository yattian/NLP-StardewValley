week consider way time planting fruit tree getting fruit first tree need mature 28 day lastly need lot resource money otherwise lot item locked behind paid upgrade eg animal cooking fishing rod easier fishing resource heavy crafting eg keg cheese press artisan bundle every season determine cash crop eg strawberry spring blueberry summer cranberry fall plant 23rds field crop remaining 13rd use bit crop way get cash need also enough crop eg cooking crop bundle gift giving artisanal use wine jelly etc sell cash crop keep number others 1015 typically us fishing bundle consider following higher skill easier mini game bar grows bait help lot getting fish bite pay sell fish need bundle difficult fish eg pufferfish sturgeon use trap bobber tackle note use bait must least fibreglass rod bait

third farm seems hard started second farm switched planned marrying picked farm map lended choice like picking mining map focusing mining early game using amethyst abigail gift get mod right platform checkout stardew valley expanded altered new townspeople event world map item item reworks well optionals farm map rework tighter profit margin balanced crafting harder building construction cost stronger monster mature character event longevity progressive taxes bill also price fluctuation effected relationship seller seasonal availability item like real world adds wholenother level realism planning game well muchneeded gold sink imo automate create fully automized system place chest next machine machine automatically pull raw item chest push processed item combat controls adds ability move one direction swinging attack another also optionals like dash evade well blocking slide mention ability hold attack continually slash instead button spam well click move want controller support unfortunately dynamic night time climates ferngill beautiful morning night cycle light transition dynamic weather change day going sunny overcast rolling thunderstorm throughout day weather well like fog blizzard also optionally turn hazardous weather hurt drain stamen fast animations would nt overlook mod need personal configuring opinion would highly recommend default value bit skewed overpowered hyperspeeds liking theyre fully customizable let speed certain animation like eating food breaking geode slot machine speed even main menu transition carry chest non destructive npcs move chest without emptying npc wo nt blow player placed item get past npc map locations self explanatory getting know villager kn second run completely enjoyable experience really found time relationship building even thing like fishing jam mayo farm almost boyfriendgirlfriends could want golden lewis shh big plushy junimo several small one know dont worry think color correct wrong think going take 2 ingameweeks interact baby thanks found holly walking stage  spicy number year 3 fall well 4 day fair could nt believe seen started winter unlocked junimo hut serious planning ahead haha awesome seems like roe need build fish pond produce roe get fish fish pond one caviar get roe preserve jar think fish egg need build pond put whatever fish want give want eventually give egg ahhh blobfish pond throwing egg preserve jar never shipped raw caviar understand come sturgeon specifically thanks caviar come sturgeon roe specifically roe preserve jar make aged roe far know yes get sturgeon mostly stuff like people think content get geode purely random actually determined create save similar vein thing like certain floor minesskull cavern predicted well winter star partner garbage cans hold item given day certain merchant like traveling cart krobus sandy sell future would appear randomly determined inthemoment average player actually otherwise one common thing see daily luck affect fishing like said reality nt affect stuff like quality lot people definitely believe definitely ton misinformation game floating around especially come fishing mechanic luck crop profit think part cause bad google search result direct people old forum terrible profit guide fandom wiki page one updated year interestingmemorable one come across like top 5 search result google fandom wiki cow nt produce milk day giving birth luck page reference reddit thread say something totally different please nt use fandom wiki old wrong old steam thread list thing affected luck absolutely everything wrong almost impressive many bad crop guide nt consider price seed comparing like 6 harvest green bean one harvest potato cause nt want spend time breaking multi harvest v single harvest feel like written random hired writer spent 15 min game nt think thing really matter vast majority player find unfortunate wiki good job trying date accurate source probably remain top result google ever personally referenced lot first started getting minmaxing think grudge ohh yeah totally believed rock thing read somewhere casting would always yield gold iridium quality catch found pretty early nt true know profitable crop always go crop like blueberry multiple harvest crop setting greenhouse like plant stuff hahaha think changed rock thing used catch many sea cucumber could please clarify fishing recently fishing strategy page wiki listed specific place best fishing result like rock ocean mentioned reading post went check page look different listing color coded zone rather place make easier select place fish except case need count ios bug information page correct rock love ladder strats mine would love see someone able memorize work enough skull cavern see deep go without pausing would awesome see oof didnt even know bad know people make math error sound like negligence honestly maybe worth putting together actual minmax guide interested outside thehaboos youtube video simple guide based run havent really heard seen decent help area even le speed running looked code far back 12 havent seen anything theres really nowhere code would provide benifit specific tile far seen earlier version possibility true unlikely make sense lot people saw good location aim since sprite 5 tile max distance impact catch fish confirmation bias lead everyone thinking sprite fishing strategy page definitely correct believe rock singled good place fish easy find far land mean good quality nt better location depth zone easy reference wiki also get updated regularly accurateeasier understand information always without slight error editor always catching fixing mistake wiki used issue certain people trying update correct information werent known getting banned original information replaced updated wiki frequently believe bla_de tried update originally prevented despite fact read code since even provided program show ton seed based information game since there actually contact made code diver like bla_de going back updating mistake notice wiki rock sore point lot people looked ladder strats tell sure correct still feel right also feel like overfish area get garbage fish place long thank confirming thank much technically ladder spawn mine calculate manually rock going come extremely complicated technically impossible essentially memorize 40 floor layout line find pattern ladder spawn calculate floor ladder based pattern many rock floor enemy luck etcetera ton information would take long time practice master impossible cause money challenge run thehaboo xianjitv done bla_de done lot look stuff best money get day 2 4 spring year 1 havent seen talk overfishing fish pool work season time fish removed random pool cause spawn till 4pm example possible catch trash become likely cool idea lore wise though mortage idea probably could work really well joja could also try take people business example marnie ranch nt well joja corp want buy land low price help marnie providing highquality item animal produce quality animal product save business emily hayley running short money joja corp offer crappy job contract crappy payment help cover expense could offer emily hayley hand providing forageables dye make clothes sell outside town instead working joja list could go good idea instead money stop joja love see something else 23 year money easy make experienced player many others good making money still struggle 2 year seems interesting depending saboteur could fun happens pick joja route instead cc ooh like idea idea 1 jojamart progressively run everyone else business store close one one unless stop alternatively store acquired joja add dialogue villager concern 2 explore dynamic supplier chain supermarket must grow certain crop meet joja increasingly unrealistic demand year offer le le produce 3 joja becomes mining corporation deplete mine pollutes river etc must clean reverse damage 4 property appraiser visit inspect house week later receive letter informing compulsory acquisition house sum 70000 gold plot castle like gusto try think gameplay loop adding outcome extra danger hardcore mode miss payment lesson borrowing cash loan joja make take ca nt pay predatory personally could see interesting gameplay loop need hunt town folk trouble joja get something new rando every season week would move joja v town meter could level apparent town wide get rid joja get meter full town also complete community center perk community center harder keep growing random junk hunt 20 coal 10 solar essence decorative flower clint nt get sued joja unsightly soot something danger lurks around corner town getting joja nt keep evil joja giving dope perk let slide pay make go faster engage town slowing efficiency new junk collect mean time used place finding neat way get creates dragons best way play game rawr loop spend time looking people spend previously utilized resource keep avoid penalty joja take eventually way game hustle avoid death spiral want easy find people joja winning harder losing sort meter jojamart would good clear indicator player would make go 2 buck would love would awesome idea comment

modsmine modswife launching game rename one wish play mods option 4 create fancy shortcut setup automatically run game different parameter designated mod folder use vortex install mod automatically create separate profile great option thank  enjoy playing switch pc honestly time budget question new pchow many hour would get console versionwould spend entertainment budget thing get le game amazing regardless platform play however pc get update faster platform control bit annoying trying go fast mobile even bigger change control wise really come comfortable changing control scheme though played lot pc switch never used mod ca nt comment base game great never noticed graphical difference switch nt really look prefer pc console find control easier use like screen bigger actually see totally matter personal preference though pc without question console stuck given minimal control game pc offer multiple benefit savegame management back game copy send friend console impossible lot difficult mods tired playing game change feature annoying much fix mods nt graphic fluff real qol improvement consoles support none safe safety smapi stardew mod framework sincerely recommend player install regardless whether intend use mod smapi creates daily independent backup save game meaning steam whichever brain fart kill game restoration copy consoles nt big weight side scale whether intend play multiplayer platform friend use stardew crossplatform switch wherever way play console thing equal though strongly endorse pc mods much offer personally could never use console game 46 active mods counting checkout stardew valley expanded new townspeople event world map item well optional farm rework tighter profit margin balanced crafting harder building construction cost stronger monster mature character event longevity atm progressive taxes bill well price fluctuation effected relationship trader seasonal availability item well randomness like real world adds wholenother level realism planning game well muchneeded gold sink imo atm mod add atm machine town deposit money get yearly interest take loan pay back automate create fully automatized system place chest next machine machine automatically pull raw item chest push processed item create whole network linked machine one massproducing selfcontained system combat controls adds ability move one direction swinging attack another also optionals like dash evade well blocking slide mention ability hold attack continually slash instead button spam well click move want controller support unfortunately dynamic night time climates ferngill beautiful morning night light transition dynamic weather change day like going sunny overcast rolling thunderstorm throughout day etc weather well like fog blizzard also optionally turn hazardous weather hurt health drain stamen really like immersion mod even little thing like strafing cloud shadow fast animations would nt immediately overlook mod need personal reconfiguring opinion definitely recommend though default value bit skewed overpowered hyperspeeds liking theyre fully customizable config let speed certain animation like eating food breaking geode smithy slot machine speed etc even main menu transition plenty carry chest non destructive npcs move chest without emptying npc wo nt blow player placed item get past npc map locations self explanatory good point consider honestly think biggest factor going flexibility playing handheld tv got switch plus already game purchased steam get pc set would reinstall comfortable changing control improves quality life think get switch something play wherever want eventually reinstall pc whenever build another game reasonably priced easy sink hour probably worth multiple platform two point nt even correct though difficult copy save backup mods also nt pc exclusive idk got downvoted main reason wanting play pc option mod love compiled list briefly modded know one add townspeople event also improvement quality life wish automate mod new animal crossing lol honourable mention skip intro guess one horse whistle pony weight loss program guess either pony weight loss let horse pas anywhere player lookup anything press f1 mousing literally anything get info page basically condensed wiki article ui info suite add new ingame menu let toggle certain indicator thing like many day blacksmith order ready mysterious trader around whose birthday day mouse machine see long process finished lot one also add npc map marker would disable feature install use dedicated npc map locations instead specially get sve cjb cheats menu big thing like auto complete quest respec skill relationship add money unlimited staminahealth always max luck change time tomorrow weather teleport location etc personally use smaller stuff like use scythe harvest pause time indoors like harvest moon used except excludes cave hm nt finally slightly increase base movement speed essentially one selfcontrol feature want use one time done within game hidden menu bigger backpack adds one buyable backpack another row bag space 50000g tractor mod people say little overpowered also fun change initial buy price default 150000g set mine 250k top income throttling mod took long get around purchasing nt feel overpowered time purchased earned better sprinklers mod always hated basic sprinkler well fully
