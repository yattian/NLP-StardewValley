1120g iridium quality 840g gold quality 280g 280g 7 day 40gday aging starfruit wine still make money aging goat cheese entire year aged starfruit wine 125 cask make 787500g v 560000g year aged goat cheese interesting saw post someone mentioning didnt math great info nothing wrong post mentioned think come amount work want star fruit wine consistent cycle take going green house every 7 day collecting wine end season v going barn multiple time day cheese machine calculation factor price item put conclusion slightly money made 1 cask per year using starfruit wine 11256 6300 3150 6300 money made 1 cask per year using gold quality goat cheese 1127 1120 840 4480 great work large factor youre taking calculation opportunity cost extra time take goat cheese process star fruit wine take little effort daytoday compared checking goat every day babysitting cheese press extra time gain star fruit wine could used thing could even smaller goat cheese process time additional info goat produce milk every two day 35 milk week 125 cask divided 35 357 goat call 36 goat would fill 3 deluxe barn initial investment 36 goat 3 deluxe barn would 273000g 4000g per goat 43000g per barn incl wood stone however year 125 cask would make 2240000g 8 time initial investment actual profit would 1967000g first year provided goat producing large milk spring 1 brb going go calculation starfruit wine edit calculation dont include time factor also suggested would better compare price increase two rather end price im mathematician draw conclusion filled basement crystalariums cask require much math effort figure worth damn guy write money math paper farmer life real difference stuff clean mime messy factor artisan skill also thanks much info op definitely one better get rich quick tip ive seen also hidden cost time need waste le time aging wine time spent filling emptying cask every 2 season rather every 7 day even real efficient losing lot time could spent making yet money even noncompetitive skull cavern run fishing net money saved time hmm interesting havent done math thanks correction sorry ops math bit didnt consider initial value cheesewine cask dont make 6300g1120g make value iridium product minus value base product youre putting cask case goat cheese make 280g 7 day v 3150g 56 day wine wiki great chart cask page look much different artisan good make daily starfruit wine really profitable thing put cask thanks happens work ive done math whether investment goat actually worth see comment post youre curious ive seen mentioned sorry thought got excited wanted share aha yeah havent factored time gold personally like growing making bit everything probably wont even actually use thanks havent done math couple year ah well thats true there much math bothered personally bit everything probably wont actually interesting explore assuming greenhouse thats 116 max tile grow starfruit year using iridium sprinkler take 13 day grow 7 day make wine 20 day total mean make wine twice time take age iridium quality 56 day 125 cask easy enough grow enough fruit buy seed 125 x 400 50000 make iridium wine twice year 50000 x 2 100000g initial investment 125 x 12600 1575000 max profit 15 time initial investment investment could repeat year dont use seed maker minus initial investment 1475000 actual profit still get goat cheese first year whether buy seed use seed maker definitely subsequent year basically goat cheese better edit also assumes starfruit ready go spring 1 make lot money though thats totally fair rewrote post tidy version told math might incorrect check comment lol expect post attract many mathematician anyway interesting post regardless totally alright personally goat cheese like process better waiting whole season make money haha

create third farm seems hard started second farm switched planned marrying picked farm map lended choice like picking mining map focusing mining early game using amethyst abigail gift get mod youre right platform checkout stardew valley expanded altered new townspeople event world map item item reworks well optionals farm map rework tighter profit margin balanced crafting harder building construction cost stronger monster mature character event longevity progressive taxes bill also price fluctuation effected relationship seller seasonal availability item like real world adds wholenother level realism planning game well muchneeded gold sink imo automate create fully automized system place chest next machine machine automatically pull raw item chest push processed item combat controls adds ability move one direction swinging attack another also optionals like dash evade well blocking slide mention ability hold attack continually slash instead button spam well click move want controller support unfortunately dynamic night time climates ferngill beautiful morning night cycle light transition dynamic weather change day going sunny overcast rolling thunderstorm throughout day weather well like fog blizzard also optionally turn hazardous weather hurt drain stamen fast animations wouldnt overlook mod need personal configuring opinion would highly recommend default value bit skewed overpowered hyperspeeds liking theyre fully customizable let speed certain animation like eating food breaking geode slot machine speed even main menu transition carry chest non destructive npcs move chest without emptying npcs wont blow player placed item get past npc map locations self explanatory im getting know villager kn second run completely enjoyable experience really found time relationship building even thing like fishing jam mayo farm almost boyfriendgirlfriends could want there golden lewis shh big plushy junimo several small one know dont worry think

serious planning ahead haha awesome seems like thats roe need build fish pond produce roe get fish fish pond one caviar get roe preserve jar think fish eggsyou need build pond put whatever fish want give want eventually give egg ahhh blobfish pond ive throwing egg preserve jar never shipped raw caviar understand come sturgeon specifically thanks caviar come sturgeon roe specifically roe preserve jar make aged roe far know yes get sturgeon mostly stuff like people think content get geode purely random actually determined create save similar vein thing like certain floor minesskull cavern predicted well winter star partner garbage cans hold item given day certain merchant like traveling cart krobus sandy sell future would appear randomly determined inthemoment average player actually otherwise one common thing see daily luck affect fishing like said reality doesnt affect stuff like quality lot people definitely believe theres definitely ton misinformation game floating around especially come fishing mechanic luck crop profit think part cause bad google search result direct people old forum terrible profit guide fandom wiki page one updated year interestingmemorable one ive come across like top 5 search result google fandom wiki cow dont produce milk day giving birth luck page reference reddit thread say something totally different please dont use fandom wiki old wrong old steam thread list thing affected luck absolutely everything wrong almost impressive many bad crop guide didnt consider price seed comparing like 6 harvest green bean one harvest potato cause didnt want spend time breaking multi harvest v single harvest feel like written random hired writer spent 15 min game dont think thing really matter vast majority player find unfortunate wiki good job trying date accurate source probably remain top result google ever ive personally referenced lot first started getting minmaxing think thats grudge ohh yeah totally believed rock thing read somewhere casting would always yield gold iridium quality catch found pretty early wasnt true know theyre profitable crop always go crop like blueberry multiple harvest crop setting greenhouse like plant stuff hahaha think changed rock thing used catch many sea cucumber could please clarify fishing recently fishing strategy page wiki listed specific place best fishing result like rock ocean mentioned reading post went check page look different listing color coded zone rather place make easier select place fish except case need count ios bug information page correct rock love ladder strats mine would love see someone able memorize work enough skull cavern see deep go without pausing would awesome see oof didnt even know bad know people make math error sound like negligence honestly maybe worth putting together actual minmax guide interested outside thehaboos youtube video simple guide based run havent really heard seen decent help area even le speed running ive looked code far back 12 havent seen anything theres really nowhere code would provide benifit specific tile far weve seen earlier version possibility true unlikely make sense lot people saw good location aim since sprite 5 tile max distance impact catch fish confirmation bias lead everyone thinking sprite fishing strategy page definitely correct believe rock singled good place fish easy find far land mean good quality isnt better location depth zone easy reference wiki also get updated regularly accurateeasier understand information always without slight error editor always catching fixing mistake wiki used issue certain people trying update correct information werent known getting banned original information replaced updated wiki frequently believe bla_de tried update originally prevented despite fact read code since even provided program show ton seed based information game since there actually contact made code diver like bla_de going back updating mistake notice wiki rock sore point lot people whove looked ladder strats tell sure correct still feel right also feel like overfish area get garbage fish place long thank confirming thank much technically ladder spawn mine calculate manually rock going come extremely complicated technically impossible youd essentially memorize 40 floor layout line find pattern ladder spawn calculate floor ladder based pattern many rock floor enemy luck etcetera ton information would take long time practice master impossible cause money challenge run thehaboo xianjitv done bla_de done lot look stuff best money get day 2 4 spring year 1 havent seen talk overfishing fish pool work season time fish removed random pool cause spawn till 4pm example possible catch trash become likely cool idea lore wise though mortage idea probably could work really well joja could also try take people business example marnies ranch isnt well joja corp want buy land low price help marnie providing highquality item animal produce quality animal product save business emily hayley running short money joja corp offer crappy job contract crappy payment help cover expense could offer emily hayley hand providing forageables dye make clothes sell outside town instead working joja list could go good idea instead money stop joja id love see something else 23 year money easy make experienced player many others good making money still struggle 2 year seems interesting

regardless platform play however pc get update faster platform control bit annoying trying go fast mobile even bigger change control wise really come comfortable changing control scheme though ive played lot pc switch never used mod cant comment base game great never noticed graphical difference switch didnt really look prefer pc console find control easier use like screen bigger actually see im totally matter personal preference though pc without question console youre stuck youre given minimal control game pc offer multiple benefit savegame management back game copy send friend console impossible lot difficult mods tired playing game change feature annoying much fix mods arent graphic fluff real qol improvement consoles support none safe safety smapi stardew mod framework sincerely recommend player install regardless whether intend use mod smapi creates daily independent backup save game meaning steam whichever brain fart kill game restoration copy consoles dont big weight side scale whether intend play multiplayer platform friend use stardew crossplatform theyre switch wherever way play console thing equal though id strongly endorse pc mods much offer personally could never use console game 46 active mods counting checkout stardew valley expanded new townspeople event world map item well optional farm rework tighter profit margin balanced crafting harder building

unfortunately dynamic night time climates ferngill beautiful morning night light transition dynamic weather change day like going sunny overcast rolling thunderstorm throughout day etc weather well like fog blizzard also optionally turn hazardous weather hurt health drain stamen really like immersion mod even little thing like strafing cloud shadow fast animations wouldnt immediately overlook mod need personal reconfiguring opinion definitely recommend though default value bit skewed overpowered hyperspeeds liking theyre fully customizable config let speed certain animation like eating food breaking geode smithy slot machine speed etc even main menu transition plenty carry chest non destructive npcs move chest without emptying npcs wont blow player placed item get past npc map locations self explanatory good point consider honestly think biggest factor going flexibility playing handheld tv got switch plus already game purchased steam get pc set would reinstall comfortable

weight loss let horse pas anywhere player lookup anything press f1 mousing literally anything get info page basically condensed wiki article ui info suite adds new ingame menu let toggle certain

use dedicated npc map locations instead specially get sve cjb cheats menu big thing like auto complete quest respec skill relationship add money unlimited staminahealth always max luck change time tomorrow weather teleport location etc personally use smaller stuff like use scythe harvest pause time indoors like harvest moon used except excludes cave hm didnt finally slightly increase base

agriculture least insofar modern farming concerned however bad representation historical farming small farm require high degree manual labor compared modern automated technique balancing amount effort available amount work needed farm given amount land audiences today accustomed industrialscale farming automated irrigation system powered implement tilling fertilizing harvest stardew throwback preindustrial farming might provide interesting comparison show good today people posted sub picture gardeningfarming setup decided inspired stardew maybe check beg differ experience people dont

even dont understand happens theyre used aerial footage hundred hundred acre farmland even dont understand radically different compared farming century ago people trouble wrapping head around anything isnt immediately relatable actual daytoday life challenge branch science including agricultural science giving tangible point reference used starting point modern audience zero frame reference agricultural model single farm could support dozen people demonstration like stardew matter technically inaccurate provides familiar mental handhold start open door lot discussion soil depletion running farm like stardew wouldnt work year difficulty harvesting crop large scale challenge automating particularly difficult crop time energy resource actually required animal husbandry compared depiction film game list really quite long using single simple frame reference give root make sense additional information thrown otherwise becomes contextless blur care give people starting point relate reason care theyre conversation provided keep entertained exactly ive ive seeing positive result use stardew analog modern agriculture explain evolution agriculture time yes good help understand farm small stardews wouldnt sustainable whole population prefer use progress game explain technological advancement ag people understand get better stardew upgrade sprinkler hit bigger
