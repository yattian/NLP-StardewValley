115,115,"**TL;DR:** (Year 1 player here), 2 questions:

1. Should I feel okay about dumping a lot of my money to buy gold ores (400g each) to craft as many ""Quality Sprinklers"" as I can? Or is there something in the future that I'd benefit a lot from saving gold ores for something else?

2. Should I buy as many gold & iron ores as possible from blacksmith during my 1st year, before the price increase?

&nbsp;

___

&nbsp;

Watering my crops is a huge chore & significantly energy depleting, so I want to craft a lot of ""Quality Sprinklers""

&nbsp;

But smelting 5 gold ores for 400g each seems really expensive for someone just experiencing their year 1 spring/summer). Not including foraging quartz that are not the easiest to find.

&nbsp;

And I did do some simple math (as you can see below), so I'm really curious if I should stock up as many items from blacksmith as possible since it seems like it'll take me a really long time to forage iron ores (level 41-79) & gold ores (level 80+) from the mines (I'm only around level 20 in year 1 fall).

&nbsp;

___

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Basic elementary school arithmetic 

[(Year 1) ingredient costs for a single ""Quality Sprinkler"" purely from blacksmith (after mining some quartz)]:

&nbsp;

1 gold ore = 400g

1 iron ore = 150g

1 coal = 150g

&nbsp;

Total cost = (5 x 400g) + (5 x 150g) + (3x 150g) 

Total 3200g = 2000g + 750g + 450g

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

[(Year 2+) ingredient costs for a single ""Quality Sprinkler"" purely from blacksmith (after mining some quartz)]:

&nbsp;

1 gold ore = 750g

1 iron ore = 250g

1 coal = 250g

&nbsp;

Total cost = (5 x 750g) + (5 x 250g) + (3x 250g) 

Total 5750g = 3750g + 1250g + 750g

400,400,"We have a 3-player multiplayer farm that we've enjoyed for +50 hours so far, but we are all frustrated that it's common to accidentally mislabel/misclick the signs next to our chests while we are trying to place the items in the appropriate chests (example sign & chest layout as seen on the right of this screenshot: 

&nbsp;

Other players have voiced this concern before ([e.g. 01] , [e.g. 02] so I'm wondering if there are any new solutions out there that ""locks"" the sign image. 

My brother almost ate his Legendary Fish while trying to label his proud fish chest lol

&nbsp;

I wouldn't be against using mods for this, & I thought about just simply spacing the signs further from the chests, but the 3-player farm needs a lot of obvious signs & chests - so giving chest & signs a ""buffer"" space would already take up a lot of real estate that is already getting cramped in the 3-player farm.

**I would say the biggest changes are from launch:** 

- you can select now from 4 different farm biomes at the start of a playthrough. This totally changes your play style as some farms have way more water, trees etc. the biomes are Forest, Hill-top, Riverland, and Wilderness Farm Maps. Wilderness is a farm that spawns monsters at night. 

- There are more marriage candidates and more events for relationships throughout the game

- There's fish farming added on your farm, as well as other farm buildings

- the wizard now has end game magic buildings you can purchase that are crazy expensive

- completing the Community Centre causes JoJo Mart to go out of business, but now there is a final bundle to complete in the ruined Jojo Mart. Which unlocks a new building. 

- new small cavern near the quarry

- more end game relationship options like ending marriages, erasing people's memory, getting rid of your children. If you do get rid of your children, new hidden subplot. 

- a new rare creature that you can raise in your coop. 

- tons of new items and crops. Pretty much everything is expanded.

That you already have a coop is pretty impressive imo. All I worried about the first couple of seasons was farming and fishing so I could save up for the coop and the barn (purchased in fall of 1 on my most recent /best play through) 

Take your time. This game shouldn't be stressful. Looking back I realized that I got way too caught up in making money on my first play. This time I'm trying to slow down and just do what's fun. I progressed faster only because I knew some things to do to allow that to happen (my first play through I hated fishing so much that I avoided it and that slowed me down).

If you have the iridium rod, you can attach two lures. If you’re still having trouble I would suggest the bobber and the hook. The hook kind of sticks the bar to the fish to help out.

555,555,"Since you said planted outside your farm, which you can only do on the “dirt”, if you completely fell a tree and chop down the stump, a non-fruit tree does not spread additional seeds. The non-fruit trees only spread seeds when they are fully grown or just a stump. 

That being said, trees that you chop down on the “forest floor”, the dark green grass by the lake/wizard tower, will grow back randomly. 

So it’s important to keep some tree seeds in a chest so you can grow more trees as needed for wood.

559,559,"When gathering information about what you need exactly to complete each bundle like/ said, pay attention to time sensitive parts. E.g. fish that can only be caught during certain times of the year and/or certain times of the day or with specific weather. A good example is the pufferfish: can only be caught during summer, when it is sunny and between 12 and 4pm.

Similarly consider “lead up times”, the time from starting an activity until you getting the thing you need. A good example is the large milk (goat and cow): first you need to construct (and then upgrade) the barn which takes time, then buy the cow(s)/goat(s) which then need to grow up. Finally, you need a certain bond with the animal before they will give the large milk. Even if you have all resources to build the barn and buy the animals, it will take a couple of weeks. Consider in the same way the time between planting a fruit tree and getting the fruit: first the tree needs to mature (28 days).

Lastly, you will need a lot of resources, money and otherwise. A lot of items are “locked” behind paid upgrades (e.g. animals, cooking, fishing rods for easier fishing) or resource heavy crafting (e.g. keg or cheese press for artisan and other bundles). What I do is that every season I determine my cash crop (e.g. strawberries in spring, blueberries in summer, cranberries in fall) and plant about 2/3rds of my fields with that crop. The remaining 1/3rd, I use to do a bit of all the other crops. That way you get the cash you need but also enough other crops for e.g. cooking, crop bundles, gift giving, artisanal use (wine, jelly etc). I sell (most of) my cash crop but keep a number of the others (10-15+ typically) for the other uses.

For the fishing bundles, consider the following:

- the higher your skill, the easier the mini game (your bar grows)

- bait helps a lot in getting the fish to bite; it will pay for itself when you sell the fish you don’t need for bundles

- for more difficult fish (e.g. pufferfish, sturgeon,...), use the trap bobber tackle

- note: to use bait you must have at least a fibreglass rod, for bait and tackle the iridium rod (which is again one of the reasons you need to make enough money)",5,15/08/2020 9:15,0,0.015,0.91,0.075,0.9639

It's also a good time to aggressively socialize with villagers-- just walk around with stacks of liked gifts (e.g. Sashimi) or focus on a few villagers and max em out with loved gifts.

4. There’s nothing wrong with not interacting with the NPCs. You can play SDV however you like, and if the NPCs don’t interest you than don’t bother with them. 

5. Seeing as you’re looking for a mega profit, I’ll talk a bit about making the most from farming. In summer, look to plant as many blueberries as you can. For fall, cranberries. Spring is strawberries but you can only buy them at the egg festival in mid spring. Look to craft as many quality sprinklers as possible. This will involve grinding floors 50-60 for iron and 100+ for gold in the mines. Get refined quartz by smelting quartz or from the recycling machine. Plant as many crops as you can and water them with as many sprinklers you can make. Try not to plant too many crops unless you have the sprinklers to support them.",13,15/07/2020 6:50,0,0.02,0.834,0.146,0.9898

649,649,"I would advise to keep going. The only “deadline” you have in the game is that the first scoring opportunity is at the start of year 3, but you can re-do the scoring any day after that at the cost of a diamond. So there is no hurry!

Here are some things to get your farm where you want it to be:

* Winter is a great time for exploring the mines, fishing and making friends with the townsfolk.

* By going in the mines, you will get the resources to make sprinklers. I would not consider the basic sprinklers but only quality sprinklers (iridium is basically not possible before hitting the desert unless you’re very lucky). Having sprinklers will make gaining money much more easy in year 2 as you will be able to grow lots of crops without spending the energy and time watering the all.

* Fishing is actually a really big money maker. If necessary, eat the cheapest fish (e.g. carp) for energy. Use bait as soon as you can afford it. You can make several thousand gold per day if you just fish the entire day. If you are below level 5, consider going for the fisher perk and then the pirate perk, but no worries if you went another way. Keep the broken glasses and CDs to put in the recycling machine. They will give you refined quartz you need for the quality sprinklers, without needing coal to “smelt” it.

* Making friends with the townsfolk takes time. It is especially important to give them good gifts (loved or liked) on their birthdays, but you can give 2 gifts a week during the rest of the time. One thing to note though: if you’ve already given 2 gifts during the week to a person and then they have their birthday the same week, you can give a birthday gift. So be careful. Birthdays multiply the effect of the gift by 8 if I remember well.

* There is one source of farming in winter: winter seeds. By collecting one of each of the winter forageables and giving them to the junimos in the community centre, you will get 30 seeds. If your foraging level is 7 or above, you can also craft winter seeds (10) by having one of each forageable. If you want, you can thus take the 30 from the community centre, convert them all into more seeds, grow those and convert them into seeds again, up to 4 times if you started early enough. And the last crop you can sell for quite big bucks.

For what is worth, I restarted playing, paid a lot of attention to what I was doing etc, really tried to min-max and I am now at the start of winter with only just enough money to unlock the bus stop (but not unlocking yet, first spending more money on investments), and have 2 kegs, 2 preserves jars, and 2 bee houses. I was completely focused on unlocking the greenhouse for winter, which I only just managed. And if I am honest with myself, I didn’t get the relaxing experience SDV is known for. It was stressful, a race against the clock. Spreadsheets were involved. I have papers on my desk of in-game to do lists on day by day basis. And my contact with the townspeople is rubbish: most below 4 hearts (just a handful above). I will make year 2 more relaxing...",5,15/08/2020 19:07,0,0.015,0.846,0.139,0.9977

Life elixirs aren't a necessity, I just have a bunch and nothing else to use them for.

There's been a couple major ""post Community Center"" sidequests added. One is a new bundle that replaces the Joja Mart with a Movie Theater, which allows you to take villagers to a movie for a potential big friendship boost. Another is for the Wizard, and adds some new farm buildings, one that acts as an auto-harvester for your fields, three that act as permanent Warp Totems (mountain, desert, and beach), and one massively overpriced one that stops your fields from getting debris and your fences from breaking down. In addition, it also unlocks two new areas, each with a new type of fish, and Krobus now sells a few new items, including a Return Scepter that acts as a permanent Farm Totem and an egg for a new type of chicken. 

There's been two romances (Shane and Emily), and one platonic roommate (Krobus) added.

There's been a bit of a hint system added in the form of Secret Notes (available from Winter Year 1 forward), that tell you some of each bachelor and bachelorette's favorite presents. They also give you a few sidequests for a few new items, some decorative (like a gold statue of Lewis) and some functional (like a charm that permanently increases your luck a little). 

Robin can now build you a Fish Pond so you can keep (non-Legendary) fish to obtain Roe and other items from them, and just generally keep a supply. There's also been a couple new artisan goods added (Caviar and Aged Roe).

There's been a new merchant added, the Desert Trader, who trades items for other items, and among her stock has an item called an Artifact Trove available for five Omni Geodes, that acts as a geode for Artifacts (and a few high value items like the Golden Pumpkin) to help with Museum completion. 

You can now make clothes, and also change your clothes without having to visit the Shrine of Illusions (though you still have to go there to change hair and eye color, and remove accessories like glasses). 

As for bug fixes, the most major one that I can think of is closing an exploit that allowed certain furniture and wallpaper items to be used in place of some bundle items.",2,14/08/2020 17:17,0,0.007,0.897,0.096,0.9866

Also consider what to spend your energy on. Clearing your whole farm from debris, rocks etc is maybe not the best use of your energy.

788,788,"Hey! Here are my thoughts:

1 - The number of fish in the pond increases slowly. So if you put one in, it’ll slowly grow to multiple fish. The max number of fish that can be in a pond at one time increases via the “quest” that the pond produces. There is a little exclamation point above the pond when they want a certain item, at which point once you give it to the pond it’ll increase the max number of fish. From 3, to 5, to 7, etc. The item that they produce changes with the number of fish in the pond. Check out the below link for more details on what each fish produces. You can fish out whatever is in the pond yes. I really only do this for squid since some characters like fried calamari as a gift. In the end, to be honest, the ponds don’t produce a lot of profit or benefit in my opinion...




2 - The speedy fish are meant to be tough! If it was easy then what’s the point! They definitely get easier the higher your fishing level. It also helps to eat a fish that has the fishing buff. I like using the cork lure since it increases the size of your green bar. I also make sure not to “chase” the speedy fish too much. They will jump around and kind of come back to the same spot.

3 - Nope, no way to get hardwood from regular wood. Hardwood is a tough resource to get if you don’t have the forest farm. If you have found the Secret Woods, you can get 12 hardwood per day from there.

As for fishing, the higher your fishing level the easier the minigame gets. So the more you fish the easier it gets. You could also use a Trap Bobber, Cork Bobber or a Barbed Hook to make it easier (each of them do different things but essentially makes the speedy fish easier to catch).

The only real way of ""farming"" hardwood is hacking at the tree stumps in the Secret Woods (you need a Steel Axe to access it). The stumps replenish every day so you get around 12 hardwood a day.

* There is one big crop in every season (except winter ofc), these are worth a lot but take a lot of time to grow (**cauliflower** in spring, **melon** in summer and **pumpkin** in autunm).
* Spring is the least profitable season in terms of crops and autumn is the most profitable
* If you go for full profit, spam **blue berries** (summer)and **cranberries** (autumn) but I like to spice up my crops and grow a variety of them (mainly for cooking and gifting). Also always buy a couple of **strawberry** seeds on events because they are worth a lot in spring but can't be bought normally.
* Always fertilize your crops when planting them. If possible use quality fertilizer but the basic one is good enough
* Over time, you can find **Ancient seeds** (especially in the lower levels of the mines) which you can craft into plantable seeds after giving it to Gunther in the museum. These take an entire season to grow but will give fruit until winter. Try to save up some for spring and plant them then to maximuse their effectiveness.
* Make as many **Preserves jars** as your farm can possibly use effectively. You can ""enhance"" fruits and vegetables in them making them worth more **~~IF~~** ~~you place low quality or iron quality crops at best because gold and iridium quality crops actually worth more sold by themselves than the jam or pickled vegetable the jars make~~ (edit: so apparently I checked and misinterpreted the productivity (which is worth in gold divided by time to make the product with actual value, sorry).
* Never underestimate **Bee hives**. After crafting 10-12, they will bring a great profit. Always plant a flower next to them because then the hives will produce flower honey instead of wild honey.

The other useful thing is keeping good track of your chests. We keep a line of chests with signs next to them, and there's a chest that contains geodes/museum donations/bundle contributions by the entrance to the farm.

Worst-case scenario, you buy Hay from Marnie, which is 50g a piece, so the *maximum possible* cost to feed one animal for one month would be 1,400g.

As far as profits go, that [gets complicated by a lot of factors] including how happy your animals are, whether you process their products, and what farming perks you have. Here's a table giving some simple examples, ignoring the possibility of other items like Duck Feathers. ""Artisan Value"" is based on processing the highest-quality item into an Artisan Good, with the Artisan Farming profession bonus; ""Max Monthly"" is that income projected over a full month.

Animal | Product | Frequency | Artisan Value | Max Monthly
:--|:--|:--|--:|--:
Chicken | Egg | 1 day | 266g | 7,448g
Chicken | Large Egg | 1 day | 399g | 11,172g
Void Chicken | Void Egg | 1 day | 385g | 10,780g
Duck | Duck Egg | 2 days | 525g | 7,350g
Dinosaur | Dinosaur Egg | 7 days | 1,120g | 4,480g

As you can see, plain old Chickens make the most money when you have the Artisan perk (when they're at high levels of friendship and happiness), but no animal *loses* money, even if you're buying hay for it every single day. A full Deluxe Coop of 12 fully-grown, fed Dinosaurs with their Mood high enough to guarantee egg production will generate 53,760g per month in Dinosaur Mayonnaise with the Artisan profession. Even if you're buying Hay for every animal every day, that's still a net profit of 39,360g.

Obviously this doesn't account for initial outlays, like building and upgrading the Coop, or the initial incubation and growing period when your Dinosaurs aren't producing anything. But any coop animal *will* be profitable so long as it's fed and cared for, so it's just a matter of how long it takes to earn back that initial investment.",6,17/06/2020 11:23,0,0.011,0.869,0.12,0.9885

This allows the grass to spread out still so you don’t have to plant as much grass starter, but it blocks the animals from eating all the grass. Below is a google image of what this looks like.

Place a couple grass starters around the field and then place fences on the same tile you put the grass starter.

1018,1018,"In general, consider watching some YouTube videos of beginner tips and what not to do. There’s a lot out there. That said, here are some of my thoughts:

* First and foremost, SDV is about having fun. You can min-max but it will spoil the relaxed nature of the game. You may read about a scoring even at the start of year 3, but know that you can continue your farm after that and that you can retro get the scoring event any time after the first one. As such, take the time you want and need.

* At the start you’re mainly limited by energy; you’ll probably run out energy before you run out of time in the day. Consider what you need to do, usually planting or watering crops, and the rest is for other activities. It is tempting to clear your entire farm of debris etc, but I don’t find that the best investment of time. Clear the area you need, plus a buffer, but there’s no point in clearing the south west if you never go there.

* Good energy sources are mainly from food. Forageables are often better eaten than sold. In spring you can find spring onions in the forest south of your farm (south eastern corner). From 15 to 18 spring, you can also find salmonberries on the bushes (shown by red berries on the bushes). If you shake the bush, you get the berries. During those days, run around the whole map looking for the berries. They can be a good source of energy for multiple months. There’s an equivalent berry season in fall for blackberries.

* Running around the map takes **a lot** of time so consider planning where you need to be each day. If you go to the mountains, then the beach, and then the forest, you will spend most of the day running around not doing much.

* Sundays are the first day of a new week. On that day, forageables reset so consider foraging on Saturday before the reset. Especially at the beach you can find lots of valuable stuff on Saturday. Saves you going there each day.

* Fridays and Sundays, the traveling merchant comes to the forest. She sells some interesting stuff, but most of that is only really useful if you are looking to min-max.

* Crops vary in profitability. Some good crops for each season are: strawberries and cauliflower in spring, blueberries in summer, cranberries in fall. You can partially specialise, but other crops can be useful for gifts and community centre bundles. I tend to do 2/3rds cash crops (that I sell) and 1/3rd other crops that I keep in a chest. Keep in mind that the more crops you plant, the more energy you will spend on watering. 

* Watch TV in the morning. It will tell you your luck level and the weather for the next day. If you want to upgrade your watering can, do it (after watering your crop that day) when the next will be rainy. On Sundays, there is a cooking show that can teach you recipes for cooking. The kitchen is unlocked for 10,000g at Robin’s carpenter’s shop. I would wait with unlocking until year 2, but learn the recipes before. On certain days, there will be a show called “Living off the land” which will tell you about what is going on, e.g. berry picking season.

* Fishing can be a good way to get money. Upgrade to the fibreglass rod to be able to use bait or the iridium rod to use both bait and tackle. The mini game gets easier the more you do it (fishing level makes the green bar bigger). It is a good way to spend some left-over energy. You catch different fish in different areas (mainly: river, lake or ocean).

* Mining will give you resources you need for crafting. A lot of useful craftables require metals (copper, iron, gold, iridium) which you get from the mines.

* Give people gifts on their birthdays. The calendar is up at Pierre’s store. Greeting people each day you see them also helps friendship level. You can also give everyone 2 gifts per week (including birthday gift). Once you reach a certain level of friendship with each person, they will sometimes send you gifts by mail. On the wiki you can find what everyone likes, or you can discover it through talking to people or trial and error.

* Robin can construct buildings for you. This includes a coop and barn for animals (you buy the animals from Marnie). However this is expensive, so you may want to wait a while. Before getting animals, get a silo and cut grass with your scythe to get hay (deposited directly into the silo). One of the buildings is a stable, which gives you the horse. However, this is later game content.

* A big challenge is doing the Community Centre. It will likely take you into year 2 or beyond to do all tasks there.",7,15/08/2020 21:34,0,0.016,0.852,0.132,0.9987

 Rabbits are awful for money, the only useful thing about them is that rabbit feet are good for gifts. Dinos are also actually pretty bad, they're mostly for novelty.

- [Spring]

&nbsp;

- [Summer]

&nbsp;

- [Fall]

- [Winter]


I'd have bought all of the Strawberries that I could have if I had known that Egg Festival will be the only time I could have bought it.

And you probably only need 2-4 scarecrows during your 1st year of SDV calendar.

1168,1168,"Yeah, tell me about it.

First playthrough here on the Switch, Fall of Year 2. I forewent the use of sprinklers up to this point because of the 8x8 limitations of the quality ones and the scarcity of iridium ore even after reaching the bottom of the mines.

Turns out trying to go straight for Iridium Sprinklers is a stupid move. It's a mere 20x10 farm and I spend the entire morning watering the damned thing with the steel can (every other tool is gold, an investment I made quickly because I wanted to get as much energy as I could as possible.) , while also having to tend to a mere 10 fruit trees, clean my OTHER trees of all the smaller trees around them because otherwise I can't get to the sappers, and then run to the other side of the farm to tend to the 20 animals and collect and put in the artisan goods producers. (Thankfully, I managed to upgrade both to Deluxe Barn and Coop as well as buy the auto-collectors. Now all I do is go and pet every single one of them for the hearts and to check if they're running low on hay. It's eased up the process significantly.)

I'm making 8000-15000 on average. Which isn't great, but it means that I get to make upgrades without worrying too much about whether I'll be able to afford seeds the next day or not. (And to give you an idea of the amateur hour that's going on here, when I got the Dinosaur egg, I donated it immediately.)

So at the moment I do everything within my power to gain as much gold ore, coal and iron ore as I can find to start making sprinklers for the winter, when I'll be heavily revising the way my farm looks and functions.

Thankfully, I only need a truffle and a rabbit's foot to complete the Community Center, both of which are underway, so I don't need to worry about fishing anymore. (The learning curve on that was cruel... Didn't even bother with the training rod, it would just lull me into a false sense of competence until I switched to the bamboo rod again and I got completely wrecked by a single catfish.)

&#x200B;

In conclusion: Automate early, kids. Flesh is finite and flawed, steel is eternal.

I know that you can increase the quality of wine in a cask with one of the new updates, but I guess I was curious if it's better to sell gold/silver cranberries/blueberries/etc. and preserve the 'no-star' fruit/veggies for a keg or preserves jar.

If you are processing your crops you get no value out of fertaliser. You are better to go for speed gro and potentially get another full harvest out of your fields.

If you have fertalise gro in the ground, you can preserve it over seasons by planting a multi season crop in it, harvesting in the new season. I.e. at the end of summer plant wheat, and harvest it fall 1. You keep the fertaliser, and the ground is already tilled.

1466,1466,"I don’t agree with the above about the sweet gem berry. It is easily the most profitable fall crop. 

Yes the sweet gem berry seed costs 1000g and only makes 300% of the seed price. So it sells for 3000g which comes out to 2000g profit. For grapes, the seed costs 60g. You can harvest a single plant 7 times a season. If they are gold quality they sell for 120g each for a total sell of 840g. Minus seed cost this is a profit of 780g. 

Where did you get the 800% for grapes?

Another downside of the grapes is they grow on a trellis. You can’t walk through the trellis so you might lose a lot of farming area since you can block yourself in. For example a 3x3 plot you’re not going to be able to access the middle (unless Junimos are harvesting for you).

The reason cranberries are better than grapes is they yield two fruit each harvest per plant, with a chance of more than two. The cranberry seed costs 240g. You can get 5 harvests per cranberry plant. If they sell for 112g each, or 224g each plant (two fruit each harvest, sometimes more), this comes out to a sell price of 1120g per plant. Minus seed price you make a profit 880g. Plus cranberries don’t use a trellis so you can potentially plant more and not get blocked in.",7,30/05/2020 2:13,0,0.031,0.867,0.102,0.9464

Once you know how to make jelly/pickles and wine, what I'd suggest is that sell the gold/silver crops keep the normal ones to turn them into jelly/pickles/wine as they sell for 2x the base value and 3x for wine.

If you do give them two gifts in a week, you will also receive a 10 friendship point bonus at the end of the week for doing so. Lastly, you can get 20 friendship points per day by talking to the NPC every day. This means that the maximum friendship points you can get for an NPC in a week is 310 by giving them two loved gifts and talking to them every day. This works out to be 1.24 hearts per week if you do this every week.

Stardew Valley is designed to be a relaxing game and has no real deadline. There is a scoring event *for the first time* at the start of year 3, but you can trigger it anytime you want after that. As such, there’s no real reason to try to do things quicker than naturally.

As has been remarked by some game developers, players will optimise the fun out of games. Due to its intended relaxed nature, Stardew Valley is especially affected by optimising the fun out of it. The strength of the game and story is that of successfully integrating into a laid back community, after having experienced the mind numbing boredom of being a cog in a corporate machine. When you optimise for doing things quickly, you typically don’t have the time to go walk around town and meet and chat with the townsfolk. As such, you kind of miss out on the stories of the people, and you miss the main objective of the game: relaxing.

In that vein, keep in mind blackberry season when Fall rolls around! You get an absolute ton of blackberries just running around the forest and your farm shaking all the bushes, which is an amazing source of free energy.

Oh and farm the shit out of wood.      
I had 3 stacks of 999 and used most of it. I'd clear all the trees on the whole map and then replant the seeds, trees outside of the farm only regrow if you chop the stump too and you can plant tree seeds outside if you hoe the earth first.     

While you're upgrading everything, work to a goal. My first thing was that I didn't want to waste half the day watering crops, so I smashed through the mines and got enough gold, iron, and quartz to make a shit ton of sprinklers.     
Then, I finished the winter forage bundle and got a load of seeds to plant in winter which grow into forage crops. Put the crystal fruit into wine and the yam-looking things into a seed maker to make more seeds.

Mines and winter seeds are most important but you can do whatever. Try fishing and talking to everyone everyday to build friendship points.

With just a few days of mining (once you've unlocked the right levels in the mine), you can have 12 sprinklers which will take care of your 100 plots of cropland.

That will save you a truckload of energy every morning and several hours of each day.

You can't scale your farm without sprinklers and lvl 3 ones are a long way out due to requiring Iridium.

Work the mines if you aren't at 80+ as you need to get there for gold ore drops.  

For money, get a horde of Preserves Jars to put all your crops through before selling.  They are easy enough to make and will more than double your profits from crops.

In terms of gameplay though, the only suggestion I have is to start taking a look at building yourself a coop and/or barn and getting yourself some livestock. When winter rolls around, crops won’t grow, so they will be your strongest source of consistent income that season (besides fishing, lol). Just a heads up too: while pigs are normally the highest money makers for livestock (truffles turned into truffle oil makes crazy good money), they don’t forage for truffles in winter.

As you go deeper into the mines, your ability to get more ore will increase and resource collection will speed up through skill level ups and tool upgrades (which I'd recommend doing during winter since there will be no crops to take care of).",1,31/08/2020 18:44,0,0.022,0.829,0.149,0.8901
1765,1765,"Thank you. I'm assuming the luau is like a potluck? I have a red mushroom that I found from the cave for the event, I don't know whether this game has mushroom stew like Minecraft.

Okay, I'll look into the barn. I'm looking to upgrade to steel watering can ASAP as watering is taking up a lot of energy and time with the bronze one. I spend my money as soon as I get them so I'm struggling to upgrade my tools. As of now I have every tool bronze.

I'm am farming with tonnes of mealons and blueberries (100+ in total). Btw are cofee beans worth it to plant? Im getting a few beans now.

I missed out some of the spring community bundles so I'm trying to aim for the summer ones.

With fishing, I'm fishing by the pier (connected to the beach extension with corals). Are there any more valuable locations?",1,31/07/2020 22:30,0,0.031,0.865,0.103,0.8766

1767,1767,"The luau is kinda like a potluck, but in the sense that there is one soup the entire town is making together and each person contributes a different ingredient. Do not use the red mushroom (it's poisonous) unless you want to lose relationship points with the townspeople; purple mushrooms are a good choice, though rarer than their red counterparts. You'll probably find some deeper in the mines.

As your farming skill levels up, you'll eventually unlock quality sprinklers -- I am not exaggerating when I say this is one of the biggest advantages you'll unlock, as you can completely remove the need to ever water your plants again (after the initial sowing of the seeds, naturally) and dedicate that time/energy spent to something else. Each quality sprinkler requires 1 iron bar, 1 gold bar, and 1 refined quartz, so go ahead and start saving up if you can so you can make as many as you need as soon as you unlock them.

Melons and blueberries are good money makers for summer; coffee not so much. They're really good when you upgrade your house and unlock the ability to cook your own food, and thus can turn your coffee crops into actual coffee that makes zipping through the mines much easier, but that's more of an end game thing than a year 1 thing (and there are better alternatives to coffee anyways). 

The fish vary by time of day, location, and season -- in summer, the docks are a really good place since you can catch pufferfish, octopus, and super cucumbers that all sell for a lot. That said, the largmouth bass you can catch in the mountain lake (outside of the mines entrance) are much easier to consistently catch at lower fishing skill and still sell for a decent chunk.

For the community center, I wouldn't worry too unduly about the bundles. The best ones are the seasonal crop bundles (completing all unlocks the greenhouse, where you can grow any crop in any season) and the vault (unlocks access to the desert, which has the skull mines you'll want to delve into after you finish the mountain mines).",1,1/08/2020 7:50,0,0.028,0.85,0.122,0.9887
1768,1768,"Thanks for the extremely detailed information.

Too late, I poisoned the entire town.

I'm now spending too much energy watering plants which leaves me depleted. I'm hoping to use the lull in winter to focus on getting a lot of those sprinklers.

Are there any places better than the docks? Also for the tackles, are they a passive item or a one use item?

For farm animals, how do I make them happy? I gave my cows hay but they are in a bad mood.",1,1/08/2020 7:57,0,0.072,0.806,0.122,0.1999
1769,1769,"RIP the town, haha. Sorry I didn't reply sooner to warn you.

If you're not aware, there is hot springs that should be unlocked for you by now that regens energy. If you spend all your energy in the morning watering crops, just take the north exit out of your farm, pass through the next area toward Robin's place, then go north toward the train tracks -- the building in the left corner there is the spa. Just hop in and chill in the water until all your energy is back at the cost of an hour or two.

Docks are best if you can consistently catch fish. Tackles are passive, but have a durability -- and you need the highest tier rod, the iridium rod, in order to equip them. If you haven't already, I strongly recommend turning all bug meat you get into bait and attaching that to your rod as well (requires at least a fiberglass rod). It noticeably increases your efficiency by lowering the time between catching fish. 

Animal happiness increases (very gradually) over time as long as you're feeding them and petting them every day. Hay makes them happy, but keeping the barn door open and letting them graze on grass (you can buy grass starters at Pierre's if you already cut all your natural grass down) makes them happier faster and more consistently.",1,1/08/2020 8:06,0,0.038,0.826,0.136,0.9782
1770,1770,"No worries, it was funny to see it happen.

Thanks for the tips! I am appreciating it a lot.

May I know when should I get an iridium rod? Is it on high priority?

Right now my main priority for expenditure is upgrading my hoe/watering can/pick to steel ASAP, spamming barns to survive the winter and spamming high value summe crops. I have a personal account (currently in summer) and an account which I play with a friend (fall).

Are crab pots worth it? They seem like a luxury as they only offer one fish a day. Unless I get a huge amount of them.

Are the speedy fertilisers worth it? I'm currently using the basic one made from sap",1,1/08/2020 8:13,0,0.044,0.753,0.203,0.9622
1771,1771,"If you're not having any trouble catching fish, I'd say the iridium rod is pretty low priority. You'll definitely want it if you ever go for the super difficult fish or the legendary ones, but for just money fishing, fiberglass is more than enough.

Crab pots are definitely not worth it beyond helping complete the fish bundles for the community center.

Speed-Gro (and the Deluxe version) is super helpful yes, especially with long wait crops, since sometimes you can get an extra yield out of a season. Bear in mind that if used on multi-harvest crops like blueberries or cranberries, it only applies to the very first harvest -- all subsequent ones will be the standard time. So in terms of profit, basic or quality fertilizer will net you higher returns on multiharvest crops.",1,1/08/2020 8:39,0,0.034,0.787,0.178,0.9688

2014,20,"It works exactly the same in skull cavern so it's still just a small factor but finding ladders is a lot more important in the SC than in the mines since getting lower quickly is much more important so going on better luck days is a good idea. 

Luck buff foods in conjunction with good daily luck can be quite helpful, especially if you've got a magic rock candy since every +1 buff gives you +1% so all together you can get a max +7% chance of ladders from rocks. 

That being said though, I've done a lot of SC grinding for minmax runs and even if it's bad luck I've gone and managed to get well beyond level 100. Like I mentioned in another comment, ladders from monsters is 15% not affected by luck so you'll find a decent amount of ladders that way. Ladders have a 20% chance of being shafts in SC that can drop you up to 15 levels and that's not affected by luck either so all you need is to find some shafts and some irl luck to get far in the SC.

The tractor is a mod. To get a giant crop, plant melons, cauliflower, or pumpkins in a 3x3 square. They can randomly combine into one giant crop. It’s like a 1% chance or something I think. But they drop 15-21 of whatever they are and you have to use an axe. The center crop has to be fully grown and watered.

* holding down the action button while using an upgraded tool makes it go through all the colors leading to its final upgrade
* you can refill the watering can in the sink
* putting a fence or a lightning rod on grass prevents it from being eaten by animals while letting it spread around, 
* you can plant trees outside of the dirt area in the greenhouse
* blocking Pam's path makes her walk to the bus faster
* putting a tile under a scarecrow or a sprinkler prevents you from hoeing it accidentally.

• Blocking Pam’s path will stop her from walking for a short period of time, so idk if her walking faster just compensates for the time lost.

2168,0,"Some details:

1. My personal rules were no animation-cancelling (because I play with a controller and not a keyboard) and no Skull caverns (just because it's boring to go there every day).  So this is very different from Tooshi's one-year runs if you've watched his videos (which are amazing).  Also, no buying things seeds from Pierre and immediately reselling them to artificially inflate total earnings.  Any leftover seeds, ore, etc. that I bought I wasn't allowed to sell at the end.   Stardew Predictor was used extensively to predict geodes, mushroom floors, and two important things at the beginning.  
2. I used Stardew Predictor to set up two things at the start of the game - a Coffee Bean for sale from the Traveling Cart on Day 5, and a Prismatic Shard that was available for I think my 47th geode.  That let me get the Galaxy Sword super early, which saves a ton of time in the mines.
3. Spring  - Lots of fishing early for initial cash, then buy about 180 strawberries and focus on the mines to build up sprinklers.  Also growing my first coffee plants, planting lots of Oak Trees, and upgrading all my tools to bronze.
4. Summer - coffee plants start to explode and take up the most space.  Also plant 100 hops plants and as many Starfruit as I can afford.  Once I hit Summer 8 or so I stop planting new coffee plants and start brewing coffee, which is my primary source of cash until I can get starfruit wine.  After Summer 19 (last day to plant Starfruit) plant Wheat with Deluxe Speed-Gro and leave it up till the first day of Fall so the fertilizer stays.
5. Fall - all about the Pumpkins.  Plant as many as possible (about 1600 or so) on the first day, then fill out whatever space remains on the farm with sprinklers and more Pumpkins, then Wheat after Fall 19 (last day to plant pumpkins).  Also get the greenhouse going with Starfruit (ideally you get this done by the end of Summer).  Late Fall is when the big money finally starts rolling in and you can start buying Wood, Stone, and Coal for mass Preserves Jars.
6. Winter - process everything (Pumpkins in the Jars, Starfruit, Hops, and Wheat in the Kegs) and scour for winter forageables for Winter Seeds.  It's really a challenge to build up enough kegs and jars to process everything before Spring - I had probably around 700 jars and 400-500 kegs by the end.",3,13/09/2020 10:27,39,0.029,0.939,0.032,0.3612

2291,119,"So I got this as well as the “don’t die” achievement.  I suck at bullet hell, so trust me when I say you will get better as you practice.

Some general rules, you want to hold the middle as long as you can so you can shoot all 4 spawning points as enemies flood in. Only give up the middle if it means death or you may want to risk losing it to get a 5 coin. Second, move and shoot diagonal as often as possible. Not only will enemies move slower diagonally, they will also run into your line of fire as other enemies die, making aiming much easier. Always try to keep a powerup in your reserve slot for when you are about to die. Wheels and the sheriff’s badge are the best powerups when trying to save yourself from death.

Now for the upgrade shop. The upgrades go: shoes (player speed increase) < gun (fire rate increase) < ammo (damage increase). Buy ammo as soon as possible, and consider skipping buying anything at all if you are close to buying an ammo upgrade and wait until the next shop (shops appear every 2 levels). You want to have at the very least 2 ammo upgrades by the 3rd “world” or every enemy takes more than 1 hit. With 2 ammos, the fast flying enemies go down in one, while the VERY slow mummies take 2. With only one, they take 2 hits and 3 hits respectively.

For bosses, the first 2 bosses are identical and easy if you are patient. They have 3 attacks. The first you are lucky to land one hit without dying. They will rush to the end of the screen, rapid fire at you, them rush back. Just stay behind cover during this attack. The second is the intended way to get most of your damage off. Theu will move back and forth from one end of the screen to the other, eventually “resting” and leaving an opening. Unfortunately where they rest seems to be random and they may rest behind cover, making it so you cant hit them. For their 3rd attack, you can kill them insanely quickly if you know the exploit. They mirror your movements and rapid fire at you. However, there is a spot on the very edge of their cover where you can hit them, but their bullets hit the cover instead of flying towards you. I would look up a video on this before you try to more understand how to do it. 

Now for the final boss. I never beat him legit. I used a kinda-exploit, but it isn’t really an exploit as it is the game functioning as intended. If you managed to at the minimum get 2 gun upgrades, 2 ammo upgrades, and have a rapid fire or sheriff’s badge in your powerup reserve, you can move slightly to the left, dodge the boss’s first attack which is always a rapid fire straight up the middle of the field, and ki him before he even moves on to his next attack.  

I would recommend looking up youtube tutorials for a visual on all of this, but I got it fairly easily after I knew all of this info.",26,12/09/2020 8:28,43,0.103,0.841,0.055,-0.9791

2298,126,"For the first world, the safest strategy is at least for me standing in the corner, because enemies can only attack me from 3 directions instead of 8. For the first boss there's a almost pixel perfect spot where you can shoot at him but he can't shoot at you, basically borderline glitch. Even without it, the boss is really easy so no real tips here. Then If you want to survive in the second world you need at least one damage upgrade (15 coins) because of the fast mushroom enemies that have 2 HP. Basically just try upgrading your damage as much as possible. Then there's the third world.. oh boy. The third world is an absolute hell. There are only 2 enemies but both really strong. Mummies with 8 HP so they take 2 hits even with maxed out damage and imps with I think 4 HP so you can one shot them with upgrades but they're reaaaally fast. Even if you max out your boots I don't think you can outrun them. You just need to be very precise with every single shot, because their spawn rate is almost as fast as them lol. Even one shot missed can result in death here. If you manage to reach Fector - The final boss then I reccomend alt tabing the game and read about his attacks on the wiki because this boss is really tough. If you manage to defeat him then congratulations! You'll get your well deserved achievment and you can now play Prairie King in your own house because you'll get it in the mail box next morning.

It's up to you whether you want gun and boots or gun and ammo, but you have a lot more freedom with upgrades when you can get two at a time instead of just one. It's hard to get enough cash to afford it, but you should be collecting all the money you can if you want to do a no-death run, because without good movement speed and firepower, you'll get caught and overwhelmed near the end and lose at least one life.",2,12/09/2020 7:37,43,0.071,0.857,0.072,0.0337

Picking up every coin is crucial. World 3 isn't so bad with a couple fire rate upgrades in addition to damage upgrade. I recommend not spending any coin on boots. If you can only afford boots in the first shop, I'd restart. Sometimes that's just luck. Avoid nukes early on, it makes enemies not drop anything.

Fector also has a safe spot by the way. His aimed attack seems like it can target 360 degrees, but there are actually only a number of angles he can hit. If you move slightly to the left from the start you'll be safe. Then make sure you enter the fight with a machine gun or sheriff star and you'll be done in 5 seconds.

2537,2,"Cranberries are great early. You can harvest a bajillion if them. Later when you unlock kegs or preserve jars, while anything can be placed inside of them, the effectively multiply the base value of the product. Thus, a pumpkin which normally has a decent margin really jumps up. But you have to invest in jars/kegs to really get the most out of them.  And it’s good to keep extra stock until new crops are grown/winter.  But until then, cranberries, blueberries and strawberries remain high profit potentials. 

Ps: The appeal of the bigger crops (Cauliflower, Melons, and Pumpkins) can also be derived from their long growth time. Because of this (in addition to late game profits) the player is also harvesting less days (twice a season) and thus has more time to do other things.

2659,3,"ConcernedApe helped me quit drinking when I started playing Stardew Valley and I realized I was Shane.

6 months sober!

Edit: Thanks for the well wishes! I'll add some info if anyone's curious:

\-I've been heavily drinking since 2016, when I experienced work PTSD in a dental office (that's another story for another day). It got worse and worse as the years went on. I even started losing my hair from depleting my B vitamins from alcohol.

\-I'm 36F in Canada!

\-When I started playing Stardew, at first I really liked Shane 'Heck yeah! This guy GETS it' But the more his character developed, the guiltier I felt about my own life and drinking. When he ended up in the hospital, I said 'That's it. This is embarrassing. That will be me one day if I don't knock it off."" I quit drinking cold turkey. Haven't touched it, haven't even thought about it. My husband and I have done the math, I've saved $1512CAD in the past 6 months. If I were to have kept drinking the way I was, I would have spent $30k in ten years. $30k! I've also lost 13lbs with minimal effort. Hair is also growing back!

\-If you're struggling with drinking too, I'm open to PMs if you need someone to talk to. Maybe we can multiplayer co-op!

Another edit: I think the worst episode for me was June of last year - I went to a street party, got absolutely blitzed, and ended up in my own bed, naked. I live 30km from the party. I woke up in the morning almost terrified. 'What the?! How did I get here? Why don't I have any clothes on? ... oh my god did I leave my PURSE at the party?!' Turns out my friends gave me a ride home, and husband put me to bed. He said I started taking my clothes off up the stairs. I felt bad for him. He must have been so embarrassed. Turns out from my friend's retelling of the story, I'd eaten probably 30 Jello shooters over the course of 5-6 hours. I started doing karaoke, and after that? I remember nothing. Absolutely no recollection of that evening after karaoke. Frightening.",773,11/09/2020 14:10,79,0.111,0.802,0.087,-0.9538

Some AAA studios dislike piracy because there **absolutely** is a group of people who won't pay for their game regardless of how much they like it.

I think there may be some weird middle-ground, where piracy hits the edge of the supply/demand curve. Some 'indie' games may seem overpriced to some players, and that results in piracy with no intent to buy.

The only example I can think of recently is They Are Billions. It was a well made 'indie' game but with a near-AAA price tag (from what I remember). I imagine they suffered a bit from piracy. 

That said, iirc they also self-released a torrent that included altered game files that made the game basically unwinnable in the long run. Kudos to that approach as it basically draws a line in the sand.",7,11/09/2020 21:24,79,0.056,0.877,0.067,0.2081

He was healthier and happier, so the house as a whole was happier and healthier and more cohesive, and oh my god the enormous amount of money we saved meant that we suddenly went from a family that was barely affording food to one that could actually take a real vacation every couple years or so.

Aesthetically, pixel art style games are inherently retrospective of early gaming as they much closer resemble the first Mario game than they do the latest Mario game.

3153,497,">It wasn't revolutionary. It's basically just a new version of Harvest Moon that's not garbage.

>I don't like this idea that he did it all by himself because most of the game design and the gameplay loop has been tried and tested already. 

Yet he still improved on it in ways the makers of harvest moon had failed to. 

Why the fuck did they always make the main time-gated content in the series be Marriages and Friendship events, when Friendship and Marriages only involve repetition to build on? And why the fuck do they always develop at a snail's pace and have a daily upkeep? You could give that cowboy bastard in the island game his favorite dog food every day for two seasons in a row, and he'd still talk to you as a stranger. And why the fuck were major locations and buildings constantly time locked in those games, usually on a freaking ***2 year cycle***. That is a lot of pointless waiting. A lot of unfun mechanics, being kept for the sake of tradition.

The entire setup of bundles in the community center and the alternate yet internally-immoral option of Joja was a ***massive*** improvement to the formula of what you plan long term in the games, that legitimately pushed players to understand the features the game had to offer without punishing then. You want access to the desert? You unlock it *yourself*, incrementally, get bent you shitty time-based gates. It's the thing copy cat games copy the most too, most of them, even those not related to farming such as the gravekeeping game, now make sure to have a completely optional and low stakes main quest that gives you more complex or quality of life features as a reward. And in a decade and a half, two rotating glass doors studios of designers didn't bother questioning it and instead covered the gap with a tangetialy correlated Combat based progression in a (sadly underfunded and over-waifu-sized) new series. The most you got was marrying an absent harvest goddess or a past protagonist with a total of 8 lines and who doesn't show in holidays.

Knowing there's an issue with a series-wide overarching gameplay loop and resolving it to the point they overtake the original series' mainstream appeal is commendable. Doing it alone? That's talent.

I'm just waiting, hoping, for the day someone does the same to animal crossing, because holy shit there's asinine design all over that series just waiting to get FIXED.",5,12/09/2020 1:44,79,0.09,0.827,0.083,-0.732
3154,498,"Any game successful enough to have this many people debating it like this, to be this influential, and to have its success so coveted to being cloned and imitated by others as much as it is is what I'd call revolutionary. I don't understand why you assume it must be complex or exist in a vaccuum to be so. Minecraft wasn't the first block based building game either. Still revolutionary. All work, even if you began a completely orginal painting today, will have onlookers saying what you did was done before, and they'd be partly right like you are here because no work can ever be done without drawing on past influences, consious of it or not. Farming life sims existed before Stardew yes, but Stardew did not, and Stardew is different enough that could any of us really say any other game of the same genre has the same features or is of the same quality and fun? I think a major reason for its success was finding an unfilled niche and filling it, which requires originality. If Stardew was gone the closest game I'd enjoy is Animal Crossing and that one hasn't been at my top for a while. They're just not the same game. If Stardew is just the most polished shovelware you've come across, I challenge you to find me all the Stardews that existed before Stardew. Harvest Moon is similar in genre only.

3155,499,"Neither of those are pixel art games, which makes it a rough comparison.

Sticking to successful and well deserving games, one game I'd say is literally hitting the barrier above the ""not pretty"" territory but still has enough 2D visual appeal, is Celeste. The characters and world have only as much detail as they could budget, and sadly, they wanted the game to have the screen proportions of Knytt Stories or Meat Boy, which means there's very little of it. Most of the macro-design you see in portraits and ambient art (both of which are very good) is completely lost. So most of the artistry there comes from how things look in motion. They pushed their choice of artstyle to the very limit where movement is concerned.

A 2D spritework game that is *ugly*, is Undertale. The game legitimately looks like ass in the tutorial, which was a compromise we were more than happy when we saw the demo's writting quality. There's a wild amount of pixel sizes being changed too, the game has no grounding as to what scale things fit to. It gets much better in snowdin, but a couple characters still look like a first pass in MS Paint (everything Gaster related probably is). And then it looks like a whole new game by the time you're in the hidden laboratory, which kind of hurts since your player character is still on matching the tutorial stage's quality with their 2 flipped frames of walk (slide) animation.",4,12/09/2020 2:16,79,0.093,0.807,0.1,0.5047

That doesn't make it revolutionary. That makes it iterative.

That being said the time locks were pretty good in for example A Wonderful Life where the entire point was to show the evolution of the world over time.

You also miss that these ""unfun mechanics"" weren't kept in for the sake of tradition; they were misused because the people who made the series good got churned out of the development team and the licensing turned into a clusterfuck. And Stardew Valley has the ""daily gift"" mechanic too.

Yes, the Harvest Moon/Stories of Seasons series stagnated and actually backslid in terms of quality over the years. You're 100% right that they did a shit job (although Rune Factory has gotten better) and ConcernedApe is a very smart guy who managed to make significant improvements in practically every area of the game. That takes hard work for a single person.

But at the same time Stardew Valley has become significantly more popular than Harvest Moon and a lot of people seem to believe that the game sprung forth fully formed from ConcernedApe's mind. He didn't invent the idea of a farming game with a village that has people you talk to and give gifts every day (liked on a five point sclae) and can marry that also has a dungeon. The majority of the core gameplay mechanics just aren't original and while Stardew Valley is a great game it's not a revolutionary game. Heck even some of the older Harvest Moon games have the ""unlock it yourself"" shit; I played Harvest Moon DS and the main quest of that game (saving all the harvest sprites) was optional and gave mainly quality of life improvements. 

Heck I see you're shitting on Graveyard Keeper for being a ""copycat game"" when that's far more different from Stardew Valley than Stardew Valley is to Harvest Moon. You're not even managing a fucking farm in that game and the NPCs like you based on a linear questline which is a heck of a lot better & entertaining than the ""walk to every villager and give them random crap every day"" gameplay loop.",0,12/09/2020 9:19,79,0.062,0.812,0.126,0.9749

Now, my advice would be to try using a rain totem as soon as you can make one, this way you can confirm is the game or the file that badly bugged (if it is a bug that is) , as its still posible that (if it is,) a glitch only affects the randomly generated weather, and not the totem weather itself.

I have read several accounts of Mr. Barone's life and struggle to develop this game, including his own account.  In many ways it is autobiographical for him.  In a game reality and fantasy blend, but except for some really far-out sci-fi, the rules of physics apply.  The apple falls from the tree and lands on the ground, the rock splits when hit with force, force consumes energy etc.  Now, I responded to what I perceived to be a serious question and from fifty years of studying psychology, I gave my best serious answer.

 your comment came off a tad condescending, as if every person who likes their farm paved in (i repeat) a GAME, somehow has a warped reality of what the beauty of nature is and people like US (bcs our play styles are quite similar so i am in no way challenged by your wisdom or offended by the lack of my own) are in the right for allowing mother nature to run its course. id think that 50 years of studying psychology would let someone know to not make such an illogical conclusion that the majority of people who have their farms are city kids who don't like random tree saplings growing where they were going to put a seasonal plant. :( absolutely no one is terrified at the thought of the randomness of beauty in a game. perhaps I'm real life where things are actually serious, but not in a game.",2,13/09/2020 4:09,109,0.062,0.828,0.11,0.8555

3686,23,"His wife was happy.

The chickens were happy.

So were the cows.

Even his horse looked glad to see him.

But Joe was not happy.

Ten years it had taken him to get to this point. The farm he had poured ten years of blood, sweat and tears into had become a powerhouse of industry and had put Stardew Valley on the map. He’d even expanded to the surrounding lands. He’d bought out Marnie’s ranch about two years ago, though she hadn’t exactly gone willingly. The process had been… scarring. Jas stopped by from time to time to gripe about how her aunt never seemed to leave her kitchen these days, just staring for hours on end at an empty, unplugged microwave.

Some of the other townsfolk had made the transition a little more gracefully. Leah’s cottage had been replaced with a modern building about five times the footprint of her old homestead, and now served as an art gallery. Leah herself was, of course, the curator.

Not even the Wizard’s Tower had been spared. It was now the control tower for the airstrip that had replaced the Cindersnap Forest.

It had been a necessary evil. The legal ramifications of exporting wine out of the bounds of the Ferngill Republic were still… up in the air. (Pun not really intended.) But that meant that the whole operation had to be run somewhat clandestinely. But it had, at least, allowed Harvey to live his dream of smuggling illicit cargo via light aircraft out of the country.

But yes… despite all this, Joe was not happy. There had been an… innocence about the Valley when he’d first arrived. A simple, rustic charm.

And now…

He wouldn’t go so far as to say he’d “ruined” the place.

But had he?

Haley came sauntering up to him as he sat in his quaint little rocking chair on his porch. He’d started to go bald, his remaining hair going gray. But she hadn’t aged a day. She looked as beautiful as she always had. Though honestly, maybe that was just the hundreds of thousands of gold spent on Botox injections.

“Hey, babe. I’m going to take the helicopter into the city. That cool?”

“You flying yourself?”

“Nah. Maru wanted to go pick up some parts for that new… whatever she’s working on.”

“Ah. Not easy to get laser cannons around here. Well, say hi for me. And tell her that while I appreciate the sentiment, I don’t think it’s the best idea to load the helo up with JDAMs.”

“I’ll do my best, but you know how she is these days.”

“I know. I’ve been a bad influence on her. I think it was the armed, automated scarecrows that I asked her to build that set her on the path to the Dark Side.”

She shrugged. “People change?”

He sighed as she kissed him on the cheek and headed off.

People did change. They also tended to change the world around him.

Right now, he wasn’t sure that was a good thing.

First thing to do is put the tool hit box setting on so you don't waste energy, then plant parsnips, spend all your money on potato seeds, go foraging. Go get a fishing rod, unlock the community centre so you have goals for things to collect. Save money so you can buy strawberries at the spring fair to plant the following spring. Go mining once the path is clear. Chop wood to fix the bridge to the reef. Also have the wiki open, anything you want to know is in there. Develop relationships with the characters.

Fruit Bats:

\+ Makes it easier to complete the community center sooner, you get to have bats (I just think they're neat), you don't have to check in very often and the fruit will keep accumulating until the cave is too full

\- The fruits aren't generally rare or anything so the cave is pretty much obsolete in your later years once you have fruits trees set up, the bats don't bring a huge amount of fruit

Mushrooms:

\+ Will spawn 6 mushrooms every 2 days, some varieties of mushrooms can be pretty tricky to find so this helps out with that a lot, there are few other ways to collect mushrooms reliably

\- If you forget to harvest them no more will be grown (i.e. if you leave them for four days you won't get 12 mushrooms - it will still just be the same 6), not as useful as fruit for completing the community center early",3,12/09/2020 5:08,184,0.075,0.838,0.087,0.7253

If the fish is moving around a lot, I’ll keep the fish near the top of the bar since it’s easier to quickly launch the bar up if I have to, but it’ll only drop at one speed. I also make sure to ease the bar down to rest it at the bottom so it doesn’t bounce too much, because if the fish is at the bottom the bar can bounce above it a bunch and that’ll make the meter go down.",1,12/09/2020 7:17,206,0.018,0.852,0.13,0.9062

After the ghost level there’s the mushroom or red hot rollercoaster level. I like the latter better because you can accumulate more coins for extra lives and sometimes I find the mushroom level jumps impossible when they have the double pink mushrooms.

A full basement of iridium quality ancient fruit wine goes for a bit over half a million, and you'll be able to do two a year (which you will only add half a million total to the unaged value).

There are 16 weeks in a year (for approximately 4 million gold from the greenhouse), and you'll be able to harvest for 8 weeks if you plant outside - 325 plants will give you over 6 million gold.

4485,7,"You'll want to produce a bunch of different types of wine, but starfruit should give the best return on aging since it's the most valuable produce.

You'll want to use the entire 189 tiles in your basement for starfruit wine casks. You won't have to go back for another 56 days when everything is ready anyways.

If you use an iridium hoe you can collect multiple casks at once.

189 iridium starfruit wine = 1,190,700g. So that's a potential of a little over 2,381,400g per year (since you can fully age 2 cycles with a few days left over). The average starfruit is worth a bit under 1,000g so you're talking about increasing profitability by nearly 7 times without much additional effort (really the only difficulty is getting the kegs and house upgrades).

Deluxe speed-gro will allow you to get 3 starfruit harvests in one summer instead of 2. Sandy sells deluxe speed-gro on Thursdays for 80g which is totally worth it if you're maximizing your farm space or manually watering.

Besides the starfruit you should have your kegs operating 24/7. You'll want to stockpile the best produce for the kegs, and you can find a sortable list [here]

Essentially you'll want to be producing ancient fruit wine from your greenhouse year-round. Hops are also extremely profitable early on when you have a lot of farm space, but the trellises can become quite annoying later on. Other great keg crops are rhubarb (Spring), melons (Summer), pumpkins (Fall), and wheat (Summer + Fall).

As long as you push kegs really hard you could probably get to 10m by the end of year 2 without doing much else.

However while you're waiting on all of your wines to process you can also be doing skull cavern dives which will probably be even more profitable for you. Once you get a system down for that you can make a few hundred thousand a day on iridium bars alone.",1,12/09/2020 10:12,215,0.033,0.833,0.134,0.9893

In fairness, there's a number of foods that I don't enjoy 99% of the time, but when used as an ingredient in just the right dish, they become temporarily perfect.

Example: I do not like cauliflower. I hate the taste, I hate the smell, I hate the texture. But when it's finely diced and added to jambalaya, it works wonders. That's the ONE exception. So if you bought me cauliflower, I'd be less than impressed. I don't keep it around, and unless I plan on making jambalaya very soon, it'll just rot.

4591,26,It’s all about the different types of jumps. If you hold the jump button down you do a longer jump and if you quickly tap it then it’s a shorter jump. Also it’s important to grab all 3 pieces of fruit during each level as you will gain an extra life this way. Every 100 coins you also gain a life which is helpful for the later levels! Just practice and every time you play the level again it has a new look so if one is tougher the next one will be completely different.,4,11/09/2020 3:45,218,0,0.849,0.151,0.9299

4609,44,Tough to say because they are so different. It’s easier to pick up and play because it’s not as involved and you can pause if need be. Faster paced game and less to think about because you just have to learn the timing for jumps (hold jump button for longer distance jumps and quick press for shorter jumps) in each level. Main goal getting all 3 pieces of fruit in every level which earns you a free life after completing this in each level and as many coins as you can to gain more lives (100 = 1 life) for the harder levels.,1,11/09/2020 3:59,218,0.013,0.878,0.109,0.8925

4666,0,"What I do is search for similar items and see how much the good ones are selling for at shops with lots of buyers.  
  
Then I calculate if it’s worth it based on my costs and time. Is this equation:  
  
finalPrice = (myHourlyWage x hoursToMake) + costOfMaterials.   
  
So if it takes you 2 hours to make something and your time is worth $8 an hour, and your materials cost $2, you’d have this:   
  
$18 final price = (8 x 2) + 2.  
  
You can do the equation in reverse if you want to start with a certain selling price first!   
  
myHourlyWage = (finalPrice - costOfMaterials) / hoursToMake.  
  
So if you don’t think people will pay more than a certain price for something, plug that in to make sure you’re OK getting paid a certain amount for every hour of work.  
  
And if you do free shipping, add the average cost of shipping to your final price. Also look at Etsy’s fees to make sure the amount you’d get back from them after paying fees is worth it. Sometimes people price things too low and end up paying a little bit of money per sale instead of making any!",6,11/09/2020 10:59,227,0.016,0.84,0.144,0.975

I cannot be bothered making friends with cows and chickens and goats to get big milk, and golden eggs, and whatever else I need. 

I can fish, I can mine, I can dump money into the safe to finish that one too. But waiting for the salesman to have what I need, or growing it myself, I just don't care. Let me spend the money on Joja and marry Abigail so I can leave Pierre with nothing.

He is very lazy, so didn't feel like fixing up the community by doing a bunch of haphazard fetch quests.  But he does end up feeling conflicted because of the effect it has on Pierre's store, but other than the occasional joja cola, he still mostly buys all his goods from Pierre to support local businesses.

4954,26,"I have and she’s my most played run through since I’ve never gotten around to actually finishing the community center since I bought the game, though I’m working on it again (and hopefully this time actually finish it). Also this character is where I play to maximize profits (though I can’t help but still try to keep the farm aesthetically pleasing so I still decorate to an extent)

For my farmers, I made twins and depending on who inherits the farm, they choose different paths. 

For the character who goes with Joja route, I always chose the options that was more blunt and truthful since for her personality, she’s more of a realist, and values efficiency and practicality above all. 

She went with joja because she doesn’t see the point of the community center. It has been run down for so long and if the town really cared, it would have been fixed. When she discovers Lewis’s golden statue and his affair with Marnie, she pretty much feels justified with her decision. When Morris shows her the Joja community upgraded, it looks good to her since she can pay them to fix stuff around the town and she knows that they will get it done. She doesn’t know that the Junimos, and what she calls “magical apples” are going to do the same thing (why would she? Nothing really told her that was the reward for doing the bundles) and after a trip to the wizard tower, she distrusts him but she does grows to care for the junimos and gives them a home in her farm to make up for allowing the center to turn into a warehouse.

For her relationships, she is married to Sebastian since they share the same interests of board games and his her type. She also understands what it’s like to be the less favored child since I imagine that grandpa never gave her the letter. Her twin in both realities gets the letter from grandpa, but the key difference is that he doesn’t mess up his life enough to the point where he ended up in a dead end job so he doesn’t pack up and leave. Instead, he lets her inherit the farm since she is pretty much unsure of what she really wants to do in her life. Though I like to imagine that even if her brother inherits, she would eventually move in the farm with him and work as a farmhand with him.

She’s in good standing with everyone except the wizard and Linus who she distrust and dislikes respectively. For Linus, she doesn’t understand why he would willingly live like a vagrant and the first scene with him really ticked her off especially when she learns that he chose to live that way. Though since I need wild bait and sashimi, I still befriended Linus but would lower his heart levels afterwards once I unlocked what I needed from him. 

Also she probably dislikes Pierre a lot after the incident of her selling her crops to him and him claiming that it’s his but doesn’t really show it and still befriends him because she does want him to continue to stock his shop with her produce. So I keep him at 10 hearts in game and don’t bother lowering it

For her farm, I don’t bother with the slime hutch and go full out with the crops, though I keep a barn, coop, and a few sheds here and there to keep the kegs in. Though I do admit that the game is shorter when going through the joja path since it’s easier to just earn the gold for the upgrades.",4,11/09/2020 6:59,250,0.062,0.8,0.139,0.9953

People (including me) hate Joja because it represents the awful jobs and awful corporations many of us feed our souls to. Running off to live without all that, putting in extra work and money to avoid the soulless things ... it's a daydream we may not be able to live out in real life. Helping Joja in the game can feel like betraying yourself.

I really hate the whole YoU nEeD tO PeT yOuR aNiMaLs dAiLy crap when i have way better things to do.  And the idea of them not producing as abundantly by merely keeping them fed is also irksome when i intentional avoid getting their hearts up to keep their products low quality for the best profit.

I don't even sell their crap on a a daily basis because animals require a lot of upfront cost and maintenance for only a small passive income on just the raw materials alone.

There are right and wrong ways to do things in most games in order to win, and that mindset can poison your experience in games that don’t require it.  
  
What I’m currently doing to help myself is seeing goals and working on them little by little.

5120,4,"Stardew Valley seems to play against the relaxed pace accidentally rather than maliciously. For example, buying resources is very expensive, but the alternative is to excel in a wide variety of skills or invest in a wide variety of things. You can get cloth by hoping a mummy drops it sometimes, but the easiest way is to have sheep. So now someone who doesn’t want animals but requires cloth to craft things they need (such as certain tackle for someone who only wants to chill and fish) must invest in getting a barn with sheep and looms going.  
  
The game is well-designed to have everything supporting everything else, a big web of resources you acquire over here that are used for something unrelated over there. It’s great for forcing exploration and making the world feel full. But it makes it really hard to just be a crop farm, or just be a fisherman. People want to be able to take it slow AND have the quality experience at the same time.  
  
Something that would encourage this kind of play might be:  
-allowing alternate currencies to buy resources besides just gold (Desert Trader has the right idea).   
-hiding future achievements and undiscovered recipes and items from the player to discourage completionists. Or at least making them harder to see. The player never knows what they’re missing until they discover it.   
-providing more than one way to reliably farm a resource.    
-maybe friendships can help ease these burdens?   
-providing in-game opportunities to slow down. Festivals are one great way to do this. Maybe a character regularly likes to meet you for a drink on weekends at the saloon, or you and Willy have fishing dates twice a week! Maybe you help the Adventurer’s Guild explore the mines. Maybe Marnie rides a horse around and you follow her as she finds interesting things and chats with you. Basically more events that you participate in that aren’t focused on you acquiring things or making money. Something about your day to be excited about AFTER you’ve done a little bit of work!   
  
I’m sure multiplayer helps with this a ton. I only play single player on mobile, so I have to do everything myself.",2,11/09/2020 10:41,270,0.041,0.759,0.2,0.997
5121,0,"I can only answer a couple since I'm on the Xbox version.

4   My favorite feature is how you can do anything you want. The game is set up so you can make any kind of farm. Most of the time I do a hybrid crop/livestock... but I have done a ""no crop"" challenge and its totally possible to never plant a single seed and still accomplish a lot.

5   Absolutely NO microtransactions. You buy the game... you get the game. The game industry should really try this more often.

7   You can sink HOURS into this game. It never ends. My current game is in the 2nd Year Winter and I have 57 hours into it. An older file got to Summer of the 4th year and I have 114 hours logged.

I tend to only make it to a couple years each play. Then after a break I always want to come back and play a new character. You will not regret buying this game.",3,11/09/2020 12:34,271,0.024,0.872,0.105,0.8912
5122,1,"1. Not much experience there sorry. 

2. Mods change your experience or add to it. Things like saving any time, larger farm, being able to marry non marriable characters, add entirely new recipes and items or even in the case of stardew valley expanded, new characters and new areas. 

3. Yes I believe so

4. I've always loved harvest moon and this is similar but with a better mining system and more customizable farm. The ability to choose boy or girl right off the bat was different than the original harvest moons and you can choose to marry a boy or girl or just get a different character as a roommate. 

5. Absolutely no micro transactions. The game is fab and I've bought five copies (2 switch, 2 mobile android and 1 PC).

6. I believe modding is easier via PC and I prefer either controller or mouse vs touch screen. 

7. I've got 400+ hours total into the game. I haven't played the same farm the entire time, but usually 100+ in a good save file. For a $15USD game (PC and switch price), that fabulous.",1,11/09/2020 12:36,271,0.032,0.8,0.168,0.9839
5123,2,"1. I only played on mobile for a bit before I bought it on PS4 and pc, but I never experienced any problems or glitches that messed up my game.

2. Mods are awesome. And free. But you do not need them to enjoy the game. The base game is pretty well done on its own, but I definitely recommend mods for seasoned players that wonna added a little more to the game.

3. Yeaa that’d be fine.

4. If you’ve ever played a harvest moon game, you’ll know what I mean when I say that Stardew Valley is just wayyy more fleshed out.

5. No DLC or micro transactions!

6. I have bought this game 4 times on all my platforms, and pc is the best, cause mods. 

7. I have more than 1000 play hours on just my pc alone. :) 

Hope that helped.",1,11/09/2020 13:05,271,0.044,0.678,0.278,0.9934
5124,3,"1 Sorry I only play on PC, so can't give an answer to this one.

2 Mods have a wide range of functions, they can expand the story and actual gameplay, be purely aesthetic/design based, or improve quality of life/make things easier by cutting down on time spent with ""mundane"" activities. They are free and coming from someone that really does not have much technical computer experience they were fairly easy to install! 

3 Again not super computer savvy but pretty sure stardew is relatively easy on computers and doesn't need high graphics or processing speeds. You should be fine. I've never had any problems and my laptop is years old and subpar on most accounts.

4 I haven't played too many other farming games, but from what I've seen I feel like stardew offers a lot of different avenues to enjoy the game and there are a lot of places to discover. One of my favorite aspects is definitely the NPC's and the story content you unlock through interactions with them! I'll often spend days just running around giving everyone gifts (: Also the music! is wonderful!

5 No, there are no micro-transactions whatsoever!

6 Usually PC gets updates faster and is prioritized, and I think not all mods are mobile compatible?

7 I think play time really depends on the person and what they get invested in, but I know MANY people have poured hundreds of hours into this game. I have 143 hours (with like three save files) and can definitely see myself continuously coming back to this game for a long time. I struggle getting into games because my mind's usually all over the place, but stardew is one of the few games I can lose hours too without having to apply myself. Also, I think it has good replayability because you can be really creative with your play style and how you want to set up your farm in different saves. It's one of my all time favorite games I really recommend it and hope you have a lot of fun experiencing it for the first time!",1,11/09/2020 13:15,271,0.033,0.726,0.242,0.9983
5125,4,"I've played mobile and desktop (on a dell too) and there's really one big difference- on mobile you can pick up where you left off, but on pc you start right after saving. As for issues on mobile, I couldn't/hadn't backed up my save, so I lose it every time I change phones (which has happened three times since I started playing)

No micro transactions, and updates are free. I've tried one or two mods and they were pretty easy to get going once I figured out how to use them. The game is very conducive to both long and short play sessions, and there's no real ""end"" or point where you run out of things to do.",1,11/09/2020 13:48,271,0.075,0.756,0.169,0.9351
5126,5,"Since most people have addressed your other questions I'll mostly talk about the mobile experience. I've played the Android mobile version, but I've been fairly active in this subreddit and I think I've gotten a fairly decent idea of how PC runs. I've run into a few bugs but still a surprisingly smooth experience on my phone, which was very mediocre when it was new three or four years ago. You mentioned Apple so if you go with that mobile version afaik you're looking at an unmodded experience anyway on there, but it's a fantastic game without mods and I'm probably going to buy it for the Switch as well, which is also not able to be modded. Also, iOS was literally the last to receive the 1.4 update and I suspect that will be the case for the upcoming 1.5 update as well (you'll get it, it might just take a few extra weeks). The controls on mobile create a slightly different play experience - fishing seems to be easier on mobile, the more optional arcade mini-games are likely much more difficult. And the combat on mobile has an auto-attack feature which makes it less clunky but also arguably makes it less engaging. Mobile does have a zoom feature which compensates well for the tiny screen. 

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the mobile versions to someone, but I would recommend the PC version over mobile in most cases. You'll be playing for more than a few minutes, and most PC setups are more comfortable at the very least. But there's good reasons to go with mobile too, for portability and convenience - when it becomes safe to travel again I'll probably be playing a lot of SV on flights... I wonder if my Kindle can play it?",1,11/09/2020 19:33,271,0.043,0.81,0.147,0.9877
5127,6,"I can't speak to all of these questions but I can answer a few of them.;

2. Mods will change or add to some aspect of the game or another. Generally there are two types: you can get mods that make aspects of the game-play easier (such as the casks-everywhere mod), while others add content to the game (the massive Stardew Valley Expanded mod, for example). Stardew Valley is the first game I ever used mods for, and the downloading/set-up/usage was super straightforward. I haven't had any problems with any of the mods I've installed so far. 

3. This is not a 'professional' opinion, but if you can run the Sims 4 then you should have no problem running Stardew Valley. 

4. I pretty much love everything about it honestly. The NPC interactions are great. I love the little event cut scenes. I also really like the little pieces of fantasy scattered throughout the game. 

5. There are no micro transactions. What you buy is what you buy, and the updates are also free. 

7. In the game itself I have 493 hours (oof) - usually I put about 100 hours into a save file before I decide I'm ready to move on to a new one, but that's just my preference.

5128,7,"Most of your other questions have been answered so I'll just answer the few that hasn't been.

1 I think the game had a bit more issues when it first came out on mobile but it's more stable now, I've never personally experienced any bad crashes and haven't seen many people complaining about it anymore.

6 I love the PC version, I think if you're gonna choose between the 2 definitely go with PC. You can mod on android (not ios) but there's no multiplayer and the controls are, imo, more finicky than PC especially when it comes to combat. It's easier to install mods and turn them on/off/switch them around as well. 

7 I've got a few thousand hours but that's cause I got really into minmaxing lol. You can get a few hundred hours at least normally then it's up to you how much you want to replay and try different maps/challenge runs/etc. The developer comes out with new updates that adds new content every year or so as well and they're always free which is awesome.

SMAPI works as an intermediate launcher - you use it to launch the game, and at launch it injects whatever mod code/etc. into the game.  Any half decent anti-virus might flag this as a trojan or other malware (because SMAPI is injecting code & accessing memory of a different program) - it's a false positive, because without doing that, SMAPI wouldn't be capable of doing what it does.

Not all mods require SMAPI - the ones that are just sprite replacements, or other portrait & graphic mods, probably don't even need SMAPI.  But any of the mods that are going to change anything more intensive than replacing sprites probably *will* need SMAPI to function.  SMAPI is to Stardew, what Skyrim Script Extender & Fallout Script Extender are to their respective games.

Farming actually isn't very profitable till you get some sprinklers, it's not worth all that time to water them. Have you made it very far in the mines? If not I suggest spending some time there to get access to gold and start crafting quality sprinklers. Once you've got all that automated the next step would be to make a ton of jars/kegs to turn crops into artisan goods.

Animals are not bad for profit as well, especially once you completely upgrade your barns and get pigs. It takes some investment though but good to keep in mind once you've got the money to spare. Cows and chickens are best before pigs, make cheese and mayo with their products.

Fishing is a decent but much more manual way of making money, it's good to get the ball rolling. If it's raining in spring it's good to spend some time fishing for catfish in the river, right under Jodi and Emily's house on the far left is a good spot. You can eat any smallmouths and chubs you catch for food so energy shouldn't be a big issue.

Basically fish on rainy days, go to mines otherwise, sell any gems you find and use the money to upgrade your watering can before rainy days and your pickaxe to at least copper so mining is a bit easier. Eat smallmouths/chubs you catch, salmonberries once those are in season, make field snacks made from tree seeds, and mushrooms if you have the mushroom cave. It's ok to buy salads at the saloon too which might be helpful. Use the [stardew profits] site for best crops for every season.

I'd suggest spending part of your cash to build a barn/coop and buy cows/chickens for those.

If you can build kegs, plant a bunch of hops to make into pale ale (if you check that profit site for kegs you'll see how OP hops are, they produce everyday so it is a lot of work). Leave space for sprinklers so once you craft those put them down (remember you can't walk through hops tho).

If no kegs you can plant mostly blueberries, if you want plant some hops too and save those for kegs but no point if you're nowhere close to being able to craft kegs.

5291,28,"Yes! Those are the best crops in the game actually but take a whole season to grow. You can plant them in the greenhouse if you got that or plant that immediately now to get a few fruits and make more seeds with the seed machine. They're best made into wine and planted in the greenhouse or outside first week of spring to maximize profit.

You can craft the seeds from the ancient seed artifact too, those can be found from worm spots, fishing, or most commonly from killing bugs. You need to donate the seed to get the crafting recipe from the museum.",1,11/09/2020 13:09,283,0.054,0.826,0.12,0.7843

I know you mentioned that, I'm just referring to the first part of your comment since petting your animals when you don't have grass for them is the *only* way to raise friendship for most animals and it is usually important even if you make cheese/mayo.

5710,4,"The game basically comes down to powerups, upgrades, and positioning.

* Only use the minimum powerups you need to stay alive now, and try to always preserve 1 powerful powerup like Badge to bail you out later. You should be worried anytime you don't have a good powerup in reserve becomes the game tends to overwhelm you very quickly. Avoid nukes if you can because the enemies it kills won't drop powerups. This means that you'll probably get overwhelmed and die a few seconds after dropping the nuke.
* Purchase upgrades correctly. You need to upgrade ammo once on the orc level and once on the forest level or you won't be able to deal with the next tier of enemies.
* Positioning is the most skill based part of the game since you want to stay in the middle of the map but you also need to know how and when to take risks to move away to pick up powerups and gold. Corners are generally bad, but they can be good to funnel enemies before you pop off with a big powerup to clear the screen.

And then there's some minor things you can do to improve like always be tossing some random shots into the spawn areas, learning to use the Tombstone powerup well, etc.

Be prepared to lose to bad RNG. Many runs just die because enemies didn't drop enough powerups or gold. On level 1 I want to go Boots then Ammo but I'll often end up 1-2 gold short of the Ammo upgrade and then I can't deal with the mushroom enemies on the next level. In game luck doesn't affect JotPK so don't waste your rock candy.

And of course the #1 thing to do is watch successful runs on Youtube since that's how I learned all of this stuff in the first place.",2,11/09/2020 2:42,320,0.131,0.755,0.115,-0.872

* Keep some of your produce - having a few reserves of your crops, fish, and gems is helpful both for completing those 2 day quests you can pick up from the bulletin board outside of Pierre's shop and for gifting purposes

Don’t worry too much about time, though, since the game doesn’t end at a certain year.

Most of the lore is discovered through interacting with the characters, as everyone has their own story (and has their own secrets). The “lost books” that you may have found already through fishing or the artifact spots (the places in the ground with three wiggling twigs/worms) will also provide valuable information about both gameplay and the world that Stardew Valley is in.

5886,0,"I think your math is off :o 

So you're comparing the entire price of iridium goat cheese to iridium starfruit wine but the value of the gold goat cheese and base quality starfruit wine exists without aging it, you need to compare how much value the casks add not how much they cost at the end of it. Putting the cheese in the cask wouldn't make you 1120g, it'd only make you 280g.

**Casking starfruit wine:**

6300g (iridium quality) - 3150g (base quality) = 3150g

3150g / 56 days = **56.25g/day**

**Casking gold goat cheese:**

1120g (iridium quality) - 840g (gold quality) = 280g

280g / 7 days = **40g/day**

So aging the starfruit wine still makes you more money than aging goat cheese. An entire year of aged starfruit wine with 125 casks makes **787,500g** vs **560,000g** from a year of aged goat cheese.",31,10/09/2020 5:02,338,0.008,0.95,0.041,0.7184

5888,2,nothing wrong with the post but this has been mentioned before. I think what it comes down to is the amount of work you want to do. star fruit wine is a very consistent cycle and only takes going to the green house every 7 days and then collecting the wine at the end of the season vs going to your barn multiple times a day for the cheese machines,6,10/09/2020 3:56,338,0,0.955,0.045,0.302
5889,3,"This calculation does not factor in the price of the item put into it, which is why your conclusion is slightly off: 

Money made by 1 cask per year using Starfruit wine: 112/56 \* (6.300 - 3.150) = 6.300

Money made by 1 cask per year using gold quality Goat cheese: 112/7 \* (1.120 - 840) = 4.480",3,10/09/2020 5:59,338,0,1,0,0
5890,4,Great work! The large factor you’re not taking into your calculation is the opportunity cost of the extra time it takes for the goat cheese process. The star fruit wine takes very little effort day-to-day to compared to checking goats every other day and babysitting cheese presses. The extra time you gain from doing star fruit wine could be used to do more things. You could even do a smaller goat cheese process with that time.,5,10/09/2020 4:47,338,0,0.873,0.127,0.8908
5891,5,"Additional info:

A goat produces milk every two days, so 3.5 milks a week.

125 casks divided by 3.5 = 35.7 goats, call that 36 goats. They would fill 3 deluxe barns.

The initial investment in 36 goats and 3 deluxe barns would be 273,000g (4000g per goat, 43,000g per barn, not incl. wood and stone)

However, in a year, from 125 casks you would make 2,240,000g, which is 8 times the initial investment.

Actual profit would be: 1,967,000g from the first year (provided all goats were producing large milk from Spring 1)

Brb going to go do the same calculations on starfruit wine!

EDIT: my calculations don't include time as a factor, also has been suggested that it would be better to compare the price increase between the two rather than the end price, but I'm not a mathematician so draw your own conclusions!",2,10/09/2020 3:58,338,0,0.959,0.041,0.629

5897,11,"Sorry but OP's math is a bit off because they didn't consider the initial value of the cheese/wine, the casks don't make you all 6300g/1120g it only makes you the value of the iridium product minus the value of the base product you're putting in the cask, so in this case goat cheese only makes 280g in 7 days vs 3150g in 56 days from the wine.

5903,17,"Assuming you have the greenhouse, that's 116 max tiles to grow starfruit all year (using iridium sprinklers)

It takes 13 days to grow and 7 days to make into wine, so 20 days total. That means you can make the wine twice in the time it takes to age to iridium quality (56 days)

There are 125 casks, so easy enough to grow enough fruit.

If you buy seeds: 125 x 400 = 50,000

You can make iridium wine twice a year.

50,000 x 2 = 100,000g initial investment

125 x 12,600 = 1,575,000 max profit, which is 15 times the initial investment, but that investment could repeat each year if you don't use the seed maker

minus the initial investment = 1,475,000 actual profit

So you still get more from goats cheese in the first year whether you buy seeds or use the seed maker, and definitely more in subsequent years. Basically goats cheese is better!

Based on the shape of the leaves and the thorns more than the berry I agree with rose hips. Did it have a bunch of tiny seeds inside? Rose hips I've dealt with have been more rounded than that one looks, but the actual plant definitely looks roselike.  

It's a good idea when eating wild food to identify it by multiple parts of the plant, like not just the berry but also leaves, stems, etc. I'm not an expert but do pick some wild things regularly.

It’s really nice seeing “him” every morning in the game but I really wish we could interact more with our pets. Maybe even have them follow us around town sometimes. Or say, you hop out of the saloon and randomly your little buddy is waiting out there for you ready to walk home with you. I also water his bowl every day but I wish I could give him a fish as a treat every now and then. Or say, I go fishing it would be cool if I can take my buddy with me and he tries to catch a fish too.

Checkout:

[Stardew Valley Expanded]   \- Altered & New; townspeople, events, world map, items and item reworks, as well as optionals; farm map rework, tighter profit margins, more balanced crafting, harder building construction costs, stronger monsters and 'mature' character events.

[Longevity]  \- Progressive Taxes & bills; also price fluctuations; effected by relationships with the sellers & the seasonal availability of items; just like the real world! Adds a whole'nother level of realism and planning to the game as well as a much-needed gold sink imo.

[Automate]  \- Create fully automized systems. Place a chest next to a machine, and the machine will automatically pull raw items from the chest and push processed items into it.

[Combat Controls]   \- Adds the ability to move in one direction while swinging your attack  in another; it also has optionals; like a dash evade; as well as a  blocking slide; not to mention the ability to hold down attack to  continually slash; instead of having to button spam. As well as 'click to move' if you want that. (No controller support unfortunately)

[Dynamic Night Time] &  [Climates of Ferngill]  \- More beautiful morning and night cycle light transitions. &  Dynamic weather that can change during the day, going from sunny to  overcast or in and out of rolling thunderstorms throughout the day. More  weather as well; like fog and blizzards. Can also optionally turn on hazardous weather that can hurt and drain stamina.

[Fast Animations]  \- I wouldn't overlook this mod, but needs personal configuring in my  opinion but would highly recommend. The default values are a bit too  skewed into overpowered hyperspeeds for my liking but theyre fully customizable. It lets you speed up certain animations like Eating food, breaking geodes, slot machine speed, even the main menu transitions & more.

[Carry Chest] &  [Non Destructive NPCs]  \- Move chests without emptying them & NPC's won't blow up player placed items just to get past them.

[NPC Map Locations] \- Self explanatory.",1,10/09/2020 21:15,359,0.054,0.817,0.129,0.9634

I think it's in part cause of some very bad google search results that direct people to old forums, terrible profit guides, and fandom wiki pages that no one has updated in years. Some of the most interesting/memorable ones I've come across (which were all like top 5 search results on google) has been:

\- fandom wiki: cows don't produce milk for a few days before giving birth ?? and the luck page that references a reddit thread that says something totally different (please don't use the fandom wiki, it's just so old and wrong)

\- old steam thread with list of things affected by luck: had absolutely everything wrong it was almost impressive

\- so many bad crop guides: didn't consider the price of seeds or was comparing like 6 harvests of green beans to one harvest of potatoes cause they didn't want to spend the time breaking down multi harvest vs single harvest, feels like some of them were written by random hired writers that spent 15 mins in the game

I don't think any of these things really matter to the vast majority of players, but I do find it unfortunate that the wiki does such a good job of trying to be up to date and accurate while all these other sources will probably remain top results on google for just about ever. I've personally referenced a lot of these too when I first started getting into minmaxing, I think that's why I have such a grudge against them.",5,10/09/2020 9:31,365,0.069,0.826,0.105,0.7671

1. JojaMart progressively runs everyone else out of business. Each store will close, one by one, unless you can stop them. Alternatively, their stores are acquired by Joja. Add dialogue with villagers about their concerns.  
2. Explore the dynamic between suppliers and chain supermarkets. You must grow certain crops to meet Joja's increasingly unrealistic demands, and each year they offer you less and less for your produce.  
3. Joja becomes a mining corporation and deplete the mines, pollutes the rivers, etc. You must clean up after them and reverse the damage.  
4. A property appraiser visits to inspect the house. A few weeks later, you receive a letter informing you of the compulsory acquisition of your house for the sum of 70,000 gold. This is the plot of the [The Castle]",5,10/09/2020 2:29,366,0.057,0.876,0.067,0.1511
6187,4,"I like your gusto, try to think of the gameplay loops that you're adding, and what the outcomes of this extra danger should be. Is it a hardcore mode where you're out if you miss a payment. Is it a lesson on borrowing cash and the ""loans"" Joja makes you take when you can't pay are predatory?

Personally I could see a more interesting gameplay loop where you need to hunt down the town's folk having trouble with joja and get them something (new rando every season or week?). This would move the Joja v Town meter which could have levels that are apparent town wide. To get rid of Joja you'd have to get the meter to full town, and also complete the community center.

perks: community center is harder because you have to keep growing random junk and hunt down 20 coal, 10 Solar essence and decorative flowers so that Clint doesn't get sued by Joja for unsightly soot or something?

danger lurks around the corner as the town is getting joja'd if you don't keep up! (or you're evil and Joja is giving you dope perks to let it slide, or pay them to make it go faster...)

You have to engage with the town slowing down your efficiency.

New junk to collect means more time in under used places, or finding neat ways to get it.

Creates Dragons: the best way to play this game, RAWR.

The loop is spend time to looking for people, and then spend (not previously utilized) resources to keep avoid penalties from the Joja take over. Eventually there is a way out. But the game is in the hustle. To avoid a death spiral you'd want it to be easy to find people if Joja is winning and harder if they are losing. Some sort of meter in the Jojamart would be a good clear indicator to the player, because it would make you go there.

>The success of JoJaMart causes too much stress on Pierre, and the fact that he was already so work focused before JoJaMart and even more of a mess after their arrival causes his marriage to fall apart. Pierre and Caroline get a divorce. Pierre moves out of town and Caroline eventually becomes marriageable.
> 
> Robin is forced to work at JoJaMart as a building contractor. While JoJa certainly didn't supply the ability to construct anything on the farm, something only Robin could do, the fact that they sold a wider variety of cheaper furniture, furniture sales that brought her much more revenue than doing the occasional fixer-upper or brand new construct which happened very infrequently because everyone in town but the player already had everything they needed, drove her almost entirely out of business. But rather than close up shop she goes to work for JoJa, doing the same jobs but with a different uniform. She's not happy about the change. She misses the freedom. But she has bills to pay and mouths to feed and she's not about to lose her home and her family to changing times.

> Willy has no love for JoJa and doesn't intend to work for them. His small shack is thankfully cheap enough that he doesn't have to worry too much and his fishing lifestyle keeps him mostly self sufficient, but he ends up hanging out with Linus at his tent more. He wants to have a friend who will be able to help him survive... just in case. Willy teaches Linus to fish so he doesn't have to rifle through people's trash cans anymore and Linus teaches Willy how to be more self sufficient as an outdoorsman. Good spots to find berries or edible roots, how and with what to bundle up in the winter so that you don't lose your limbs to the cold, and how to fend off stray dogs or hungry wolves that wander into your tent in the night looking for food.

You can improve the happiness of the animal by petting them each day, letting them outside to eat grass (this replaces them eating hay for that day instead; and assumes they find a patch of grass to eat).

PC offers you multiple benefits:

* Savegame management - You can back up your games, copy them, send them to a friend. On console it's not impossible, but it's a lot more difficult.
* Mods - Tired of playing the same game? Change it. Some feature annoying you too much? Fix it. Mods aren't just about graphics and fluff; there are real QoL improvements out there. Consoles support none of that.
* Safe safety - SMAPI is the Stardew mod framework, and I sincerely recommend any player install it regardless of whether they intend to use mods. SMAPI creates daily independent backups of save games, meaning if Steam (or whichever) has a brain fart and kills your game, you have a restoration copy. Consoles don't.

Now, the big weight on the other side of the scale is whether you intend to play multiplayer and what platform your friends use; Stardew is *not* cross-platform, so if they're all on Switch or wherever, then the only way to play with them is to be on that console, too.

All things being equal, though, I'd strongly endorse PC.",1,10/09/2020 9:24,382,0.069,0.735,0.195,0.9827
6324,5,"Mods have so much to offer. Personally I could never use a console for this game; 46 active Mods and counting.

Checkout:

[Stardew Valley Expanded]  \- New townspeople, events, world map, items, as well as optional; farm rework, tighter profit margins, more balanced crafting, harder building construction costs, stronger monsters and 'mature' character events.

[Longevity]  &  [ATM] \- Progressive Taxes & bills; as well as price fluctuations; effected by relationships with the traders & the seasonal availability of items as well as some randomness to it; just like the real world! Adds a whole'nother level of realism and planning to the game as well as a much-needed gold sink imo. The ATM mod adds an ATM machine in town where you can deposit money and get a yearly interest or take out loans that you pay back.

[Automate] \- Create fully automatized systems.  Place a chest next to a machine, and the machine will automatically pull raw items from the chest and push processed items into it. Create a whole network of linked machines for one mass-producing self-contained system.

[Combat Controls]  \- Adds the ability to move in one direction while swinging your attack in another; it also has optionals; like a dash evade; as well as a blocking slide; not to mention the ability to hold down attack to continually slash; instead of having to button spam. As well as 'click to move' if you want that. (No controller support unfortunately)

[Dynamic Night Time] &  [Climates of Ferngill] \- More beautiful morning and night light transitions. & Dynamic weather that can change during the day, like going from sunny to overcast, or in and out of rolling thunderstorms throughout the day, etc. More weather as well; like fog and blizzards. Can also optionally turn on hazardous weather that can hurt health and drain stamina. I really like the immersion of these mods, even just the little things like strafing cloud shadows.

[Fast Animations] \- I wouldn't immediately overlook this mod, but it needs personal re-configuring, in my opinion. Definitely recommend though. The default values are a bit too skewed into overpowered hyperspeeds for my liking, but theyre fully customizable in the config. It lets you speed up certain animations like Eating food, breaking geodes at the smithy, slot machine speed etc. Even the main menu transitions & plenty more.

[Carry Chest] &  [Non Destructive NPCs]  \- Move chests without emptying them & NPC's won't blow up player placed items just to get past them.

[NPC Map Locations] \- Self explanatory.",0,10/09/2020 19:36,382,0.046,0.82,0.133,0.9826

6329,10,"Here are some more honourable mentions

[Skip Intro] \- No guesses as to what this one does ;)

[Horse Whistle] &  [Pony Weight Loss Program] \- No guesses here either. Pony weight loss lets your horse pass anywhere your player can.

[Lookup Anything] \- Press F1 while mousing over literally anything to get an info page that is basically a condensed wiki article.

[Ui Info Suite] \- Add's a new in-game menu that lets you toggle certain indicators to things, like how many days until that blacksmith has your order ready; When that mysterious trader is around; Whose birthday it is that day; mouse over your machines to see how long until their process is finished and lots more! (This one also adds NPC map markers but I would disable that feature when you install and use the dedicated NPC Map Locations instead, specially if you get SVE.)

[CJB Cheats Menu] \- This can do big things like auto complete quests; re-spec your skills or relationships; add money; unlimited stamina/health; always max luck; change the time or tomorrow's weather, teleport to most locations, etc.

Personally I use it for the smaller stuff like; ""Use scythe to harvest""; to ""Pause time while indoors"" (like how Harvest Moon used to do it, except it excludes caves which HM didn't.); and finally to slightly increase the base movement speed. Essentially this one's up to your own self-control on what features you want to use at any one time. All can be done within the game with a hidden menu.

[Bigger Backpack] \- Adds one more buyable backpack for another row of bag space for 50,000G

[Tractor Mod] \- People say this is a little overpowered but then, it's also fun. You can change the initial buy price, default is 150,000g, I set mine to 250k and on top of all my other income throttling mods it took me a long while to get around to purchasing it; that it didn't feel overpowered by the time I had purchased. I had earned it.

[Better Sprinklers Mod]  \- Always hated the basic sprinkler? Well now you can fully customize what shape each sprinkler makes when watering. Also increasing the crafting cost as you increase their potency. Comes with the ability to press a button to see which squares your sprinklers and scarecrows cover without having to manhandle them.

[Animal Sitter] \- Ever got bored with petting 60 animals a day? Well now you can pay someone else to take care of your farm animals. Or better yet, make your kids do it and call it a ""chore"".

[Better Ranching] \-  Prevents ""doomed"" milking/shearing attempts and adds an indicator when animals can be petted, milked, or sheared.

[Part of the Community] \- Multiple new ways to gain friendship with townsfolk by being a 'part of the community'.  This one needs personal re-configuring imo as its default settings are a little overpowered.

[

It's a list of essentially every mod that uses SMAPI and if it's currently working or if there is an unofficial update and where to download it if it isnt on the nexus . (95% of mods do use SMAPI nowadays, SMAPI just lets you run the game in ""mod mode"" and not have to manually replace actual game files, though sometimes this is unavoidable like with reskins.)

Always check the ""Posts"" section of a mod if you're using the nexus, before you install, often times you'll see people posting if its not working or some critical information like what to do to make it work.

If you're going to mod, and want to use Stardew Valley Expanded (SVE), I would recommend installing that one first as it will tell you a lot of pre-requisites it needs to work which many other mods require too; and when you come to do the other mods check to see if they have an alternate SVE compatible file, like with NPC Map Locations.

You no doubt know a lot of this but this might be useful to others, who don't.

I know you can also mod on android but not actually sure if you can on consoles or not, I thought not. I may be wrong. Think I probably got downvoted for slamming consoles and essentially all non-modders. I did say it was just my personal preference though. Each to their own.

It's just like any river, but takes up so much building and farming space. So I restarted again, repeat, same thing, eventually got overwhelmed and left.

Luck seems to be sometimes regarded as a force to be reckoned with in the game that dictates how everything in your day goes but luck's effects are usually pretty tiny and there's a lot that it doesn't affect at all. 

Fish quality depends mostly on cast distance from shore and a little on your fishing level, as long as you're casting anywhere that's far from all walkable land you'll get high quality fish, the rock is a good area because of this but no better than anywhere else with the same distance from land.

You can only get up to gold quality normally, a perfect catch will increase your quality by one as long as it's at least silver, this is the only way to get iridium fish.  Check out the [fishing strategy] page on the wiki, it has maps that shows you all the distance zones for best quality.

I do feel like the fishing is a little harder in the beginning. I don't like that I can't auto stack items into chests on mobile. Manually dragging things can get annoying, and I sometimes have to revisit a chest because something didn't actually get placed in it.

Autoattack is really nice on touch screen versions but there are also a lot of controller options to narrow down your preference.

No multiplayer on mobile and you have to do actions individually where on PC you can just hold down the mouse. The optimal layout for sheds is a little different because you can't reach as far diagonally on mobile. You can turn auto attack off and play with a virtual controller or a combination of both.

However, it's not a bad representation of historical farming. Small farms that require a high degree of manual labor (compared to modern automated techniques), balancing the amount of effort available to the amount of work needed to farm a given amount of land. Audiences today are accustomed to industrial-scale farming, with automated irrigation systems and powered implements for tilling, fertilizing, and harvest.

6799,4,"Which was really my point. Stardew is pre-industrial, no automation agriculture. I should've explained better. My fault.

People today are accustomed to industrial-scale farming that requires very little input for massive amounts of output. If you say sideroll, lateral, or central pivot to most people you'll get a blank look; they usually aren't aware of the *mechanics* of farm operations, but they do understand ""watering can."" People are familiar with the output of modern farming - comparatively low input, massive output - even if they don't understand how it happens. They're used to aerial footage of hundreds and hundreds of acres of farmland, even if they don't understand how radically different that is compared to farming only a century ago.

People have trouble wrapping their heads around anything that isn't immediately relatable to their actual day-to-day lives. The challenge in any branch of science, including agricultural science, is giving them a tangible point of reference that can be used as a starting point. Modern audiences have zero frame of reference for an agricultural model where a single farm could only support a few dozen people.

A demonstration like Stardew, no matter how technically inaccurate, provides them with a familiar mental handhold to start from. That then opens the door to a lot of discussions: soil depletion and how running a farm like Stardew wouldn't work for more than a few years; difficulty of harvesting crops on a large scale and the challenges in automating it, particularly for more difficult crops; the time, energy, and resources actually required by animal husbandry compared to depictions in film and games - the list is really quite long, all using a single, simple frame of reference. You have to give them a root before they can make sense of the additional information being thrown at them, otherwise it just becomes a contextless blur of ""why do I care?""

Give people a starting point they can relate to and a reason to care and they're yours for the conversation provided you keep them entertained.",1,10/09/2020 3:58,430,0.048,0.859,0.092,0.9473
6800,5,"Which is exactly what I’ve been and I’ve been seeing positive results. But I use Stardew as more of an analog to modern agriculture to explain the evolution of agriculture over time. Yes it’s good to help them understand that a farm as small as Stardew’s wouldn’t be sustainable for the whole population, but I prefer to use the progress in the game to explain technological advancement in Ag. 

People understand that to get better at Stardew you have to upgrade your sprinklers to hit a bigger radius so you don’t have to water every day, you can hire workers to make tasks go by faster and easier, you have an automatic milk collector, you have automatic processing machines. While these are simplistic compared to what we have in real agriculture, the progress in the game works very similarly to the evolution of agriculture over time. 

People don’t necessarily need to understand the inner mechanics of all of the tech as long as they realize how far agriculture has come and what it’s doing to continue to produce safe and healthy food.

I think people today are accustomed to the products produced by industrial-scale farming and they believe that all farming now is either a small family farm or a massive factory farm when in reality that’s far from the truth. Exposing them to the idea that “factory farms” don’t really exist and 98% of farms are family owned and only corporatize for tax reasons would be a great thing for them to learn.",1,10/09/2020 5:37,430,0.009,0.841,0.15,0.9913

One man has spent years of his life lovingly fixing, patching, and updating this game. Within the first few hours, the graphics will mean nothing anymore. Stardew Valley is such a beautiful, raw, well put together game that the graphics don’t matter (in my opinion). Please pick it up and give it a try, it will warm your heart, and give you something to look forward to the end of the day :) I’ll go back to my farm every so often and spend weeks there just forgetting about the world. Don’t let the graphics deter you from one of the best games that I have ever played :)",15,9/09/2020 9:35,452,0.023,0.748,0.229,0.9837

I absolutely adore Stardew Valley. The “newest” Story of Seasons was just a reskin of a 20 year old game so Stardew has way more content. The heart events really make you love the characters. Just for supporting the humble and amazing creator who has given us constant free updates it’s worth buying. 

Stardew took elements of Harvest Moon, Rune Factory and Animal Crossing. If you like those games then it’s definitely worth the buy. If you’re not fond of Animal Crossing don’t let that put you off cause that’s just the museum part.",6,9/09/2020 9:36,452,0.016,0.718,0.266,0.9896

I’m having trouble finding a Switch version at all and the one I found on GameStop website is for a preorder that will be released Nov 6. I’m so confused as I thought the upgrades were only patched into the original game. Do you know anything about this?

I got 1 year old crowns from Great Lakes instead of rhizomes. They're a bit haphazardly trellised, but good enough for a hobby I guess. Just ropes going up fences, a light pole, and whatnot.

I haven't pruned it at all to generate as much root development for next year instead of trying to get hops this year. 

Prussian is a beast. It's probably got 10-12' bines going up and across the fence, lots of 2ft sidearms. Goldings has nice pencil thick bines and formed a thick column of leaves but only got up about 8ft and stopped. Not much sidearms and no buds. 

Comet got mobbed by Japanese beetles, was afraid it won't survive, but it's got a couple thin ~5ft bines now. I'm bummed because I was most excited for that one. Its a crossbreed with neomexicanus so it's got that pungent tropical fruit.

Food buffs that gives you luck/speed will help, the spicy eel is good for both, lucky lunch/pumpkin soup is good as well, and bring some coffee/espresso as well. Make sure your healing foods don't also have some kind of buff cause they cancel each other out. 

Might be good to note, if a ladder is already spawned into a level no other ladders will spawn from breaking rocks. So for larger levels it's a good idea to walk around a bit while you're bombing stuff to make sure there isn't already a ladder. Any levels with ladders designed to spawn like the linear one with the ladder at the end and treasure rooms are an exception to this rule, ladders will still spawn from rocks in those levels. 

When you land in a treasure room a great trick is to break the rocks there too even though a ladder is already there. There's a 20% chance a ladder will turn into shafts, there's very little rocks in the treasure room and one of them is bound to give you another ladder that might turn onto a shaft, takes a few seconds to mine with the chance to drop you down a ton of floors.",6,9/09/2020 3:54,471,0.042,0.842,0.116,0.9571

It sounds like you may be spending a lot of time on certain floors.

These other posts helped me out a lot:

[

[

Here's what I do:

1. Have at least 50 normal bombs (I take 100, but you can craft other bombs as you go through the floors), spicy eel or pumpkin soup, extra food/items for health (I use mushrooms), 10 staircases >!(since I wanted to reach 100 the ""honorable"" way)!<. For extra luck >!Give a rabbits foot to the Jojo trucker driver , looks like secret note #20 here: [
2. Go on the highest luck day ( The spirits are very happy today! They will do their best to shower everyone with good fortune.)
3. Use the desert totem- if you don't have it stand right in front of Pam's door before she comes out at 8:30am. She'll get stuck for a few seconds then start to sprint to the bus stop. also yes, faint in the cavern at 2am (weird to do this i know) to get the max amount of time. At most you will lose 1000gold but no items. You only loose items if you ""die""
4. Only use 10 staircases >!if you want the honorable text at floor 100, or use more if you don't care. Outcome of what you get at floor 100 doesn't change.!<
5. Your main goal is to get through the floors as fast as possible, don't worry about getting the other minerals/gems. You can come back and get those a different time since your goal is to get to floor 100.
6. Any time you reach a floor that says 'this floor is infested with monsters"", use a staircase immediately. You'll waste time trying to kill every monster to find the ladder. I will also use my stone staircases it takes more than 20 seconds to find a ladder- like with those square shaped or winding shaped levels
7. Use the shaft (hole in the floor) over the ladder if available

7285,7,"My advice:

-Use every luck bonus you can. At the very least, get the >!wallet item!< from Secret Note >!20!<. Spicy eels are great for food, since they give speed and luck. If you have a bunch of prismatic shards, buy a Magic Rock Candy and make sure not to eat anything else until it wears off. And never, ever try this when the spirits aren’t “very happy”.

-For food, I recommend: 1) A luck boosting food (spicy eels, pumpkin soup, magic rock candy, etc). 2) A really high health-bonus food (goat cheese, purple mushrooms, etc) that you can use to regain health quickly. Or you can make that life elixir thing and use that. Make it easily accessible in your inventory. 3) A large quantity of a food with a decent amount of health. Not something super low like seaweed, but hops or sashimi or something. Remember, eating any food with a bonus (except coffee I think) will cancel out any previous bonuses, so only use non-bonus-granting items when you are using rock candy.

-Use a sword for combat. Daggers aren’t really good for anything except the slime hutch and most clubs are too slow to use effectively in skull cavern. Use your first prismatic shard to get a >!galaxy!< sword (there is a riddle that tells you how to get it in the graveyard).

-If your issue is more about the mining and less about the combat, then I recommend using explosive items over just mining everything. Also, something I didn’t know until I got to 100 my first time is that you can still use stairs a few times and be considered “honorable”— so, any time you get an infested floor (a bunch of slimes and/or dinosaurs), skip it. 

-For boots, wear space boots or those shoes with “6 immunity” (or shoes tailored to have the same defense levels). For rings, wear a ring with some magnetic ability (so you can get any prismatic shards, rocks for stairs, or tradable gems) and the burglar or napalm ring (or, if those aren’t unlocked for you, a ring with a combat bonus).

-Most importantly: WARP TOTEMS. Buy them, buy the recipe, buy the pillar from the wizard if you want. The only time I ever reached past 100 without using any non-bus transportation involved me getting two 15-level mine-shafts in a row at 1 am in-game.


TL;DR: Luck is important, stairs are tolerable even in an “honorable” run, warp totems to the desert are basically required, and goat cheese helps a lot.",1,9/09/2020 4:09,471,0.03,0.826,0.144,0.9937
7286,8,"Made it to level 52 or so yesterday for the first time. My experience has made me feel confident that I can knock it out with enough supplies... so I won't be heading back until I have my backpack stocked with 100 black/mega bombs, 10 stairs (that's the easy part), sufficient meals (eggplant parm, pumpkin soup and crab cakes), a few life elixir bottles and 25 espressos. I'll also wait for a very luck day, and make sure I have my rabbit's foot on me- in hopes of encountering more holes to jump down (saving time!)

Time is really the major limiting factor for me in the Skull Cavern, so the espressos and bombs are key. >!I'd use stairs, but I'd like to do it ""honorably.""!<

7424,1,"I like to do super complicated role plays to add some challenge and change the game up a little. My current play through is with an “Eco-Guardian” character. She is a freegan/12th level vegan, so she isn’t allowed to purchase anything except upgrades to her tools or farm and absolutely no animal products of any kind. She believes in preserving ALL life, so if she fishes, she can only reel in trash or treasure; she has to let the fish go (you can level up your fishing without catching fish, it just takes forever). When she plants crops that must be killed to be harvested, they can only be harvested on the last day of the season, when they are at the end of their life cycle. She likes to dig through the trash, and if she finds anything that can be used or recycled, she will find the owner, and return it to them with a stern lecture about taking care of the environment and wastefulness. 

Once she found a fish in the trash at JojaMart. She went in and yelled at Morris for killing a fish just to throw it in the trash. He said that it was spoiled, so she abandoned her principles and ate it to prove him wrong. She got sick and spent the entire next day sleeping.  On another occasion, she organized a beach cleanup. She brought food and gifts, but no one showed up, so she decided that the residents of Stardew Valley don’t give a shit about their town or the environment, so she joined JojaMart, because at least they were taking their time and money to fix the shit up.",5,9/09/2020 3:38,486,0.07,0.871,0.059,-0.6775

7445,0,"Unlike animal crossing it doesn’t go real time, so you can do so much more in a short time. Plus things don’t continue while you’re not there. So you can stop and pick up where you left off with no consequences. 

The only cons is the usual stuff of being a newbie. You don’t know what you’re doing half the time and by time you realize “oh I need this thing for something!” It’s too late. But this sub can help with that!

It’s a good game and has helped keep me occupied during quarantine. A bonus is that you can play it on multiple difference places. Nintendo switch, PC, on the PlayStation,and on your phone(but idk how well that works.)

7446,1,"I really enjoy the game, though I tend to get burnt out (but that's because I like to compare my progress to people's who've been playing for years but what ever) 

Pros- You can play however you want, for however long you want. You could play for a hundred years in game or you can play for four it doesn't matter. Also, if you want to min/max it, you can do that, completionist route, go for it (there's a lot to complete). If you want to focus on relations with the townspeople, or a specific skill in the game, there's nothing stopping you. You can marry anyone you want (of those dateable, and there are mods for dating other townspeople) There's so many things you can do, so many routes you can take.

Cons- Sometimes things can get tedious, you can find yourself reading the same dialogue, participating in the same festivals, and doing the same thing over and over again, but I feel that that can apply to most games. Also, as a POC,  the lack of diversity kinda sucks (there's two black characters, one being mixed) 

I'm fairly young and naive I guess, so I can't really give you a good opinion I feel, but this is what I can think of",7,9/09/2020 10:59,489,0.039,0.808,0.152,0.9726

It’s good for when I just want to relax because it’s pretty low risk. You can play however way you want.

It can get repetitive and maybe a bit boring after a while, but Stardew Valley has a pretty extensive mod community and I even use a few myself mainly for convenience and quality of life.

I’ve bought the game three times now; one on Steam, my phone, and my little brother’s phone. When I get a Switch I’ll probably buy it there too. It’s a really charming game with so much to do and discover without it being really overwhelming.",1,9/09/2020 16:53,489,0.039,0.788,0.173,0.9558
7449,4,"Well, you're not going to get an unbiased review in a sub about the game but I'll indulge you. The only major cons I can think off is that it can become somewhat of a timesink. Not that it takes you a lot of hours, but just like ""one more turn"" in Civilization, I find myself saying ""one more day"" in Stardew a lot. Your game gets saved at the end of each in-game day, which might be problematic if you have to leave right away, but that problem is fairly negligible, since an in-game day doesn't take long. It's also great for playing on the go on your phone or a switch if you have one.
